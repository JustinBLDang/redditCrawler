    "selftext": "So today I woke up to the news that my best friend passed away yesterday on his birthday. He loved this game and he grinded it out daily. I remember him teaching  me how to kite chargers, drop bile titans with the railgun, etc. We faced the hordes of automaton scourge and blew up more termini‚Äôs holes than I can count. He finally got to Skull Admiral the day before his birthday.  I was wondering would it be possible to export his game data? Me and my other friends wanna make a memorial with his game stats and etc. Sorry if this is a stupid question or the like.",

      "Ladies and Gentlemen, it's no exaggeration for me to say that I stand here before you, in the uniform of a Skull Admiral in the SEAF, due in largest measure to Skull Admiral Okami Cheems.\n\nHow does one take the measure of a man who lived a truly remarkable life; a man who accomplished truly incredible things; a man who roamed the planets as if they were his own backyard; a warrior who defended his planet in war and peace? This is, indeed, a daunting challenge.\n\nSo let me begin today as we gather here in this holy place to celebrate the life of an incomparable man. A Hellpod Aviator, Malevelon Creek veteran, a brilliant strategist, squad leader, and Skull officer. A man who loved peace and democracy as only those who have been surrounded by war and chaos can. A super citizen and a proud Helldiver.\n\nToday, we celebrate the life of a legendary man who counted among his countless friends heads of militaries from around the system, diplomats of the highest rank, and captains of industry. His friends and colleagues included our Super Earth's leading lights in the national security arenas, as well as peacemakers and warlords and men and women who live lives on the dangerous edge of things.\n\nToday we celebrate the life of a radical man, a son of Super Earth, a man who served and rose to prominence in the most conservative and tradition-steeped of the armed services ‚Äì yet a man who gave of himself and his treasure in his quest for greater diversity, equality, fairness and opportunity for all Super Earth citizens.\n\nWill Rogers once said, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt all be heroes. Some of us have to stand by on the curb and clap as they go by.‚Äù\n\nToday, we all get to stand here as one of those heroes passes by.\n\nAbove is the eulogy tailored for your fallen friend. My deepest condolences to you and yours. Farewell and following seas, shipmate. This was taken from the eulogy for Rear Admiral Jerry MacKay given by ADM Harry Harris U.S. Pacific Command of the US Navy.\n\n![gif](giphy|xqM20wZqd67j9AUplm|downsized)",

Devs around the world should study you and your teams work. Not only have you made many amazing games (of which I‚Äôve been a fan of all of them) and shown respect for your fans through your implementations, but more importantly, the level of engagement and empathy shown in the post alone illustrate what a CEO should look like. \n\nCheers, I‚Äôm also on board for memorializing his fallen brother.",

      "Hey, I know my comment will probably get buried but I would just like to say thank you guys for remembering Okami Cheems. I'm one of his IRL friends and I can confirm that he did take his own life on March 22nd in the early hours of the morning. I want to express my gratitude to everyone who took the time out of their day to just leave a comment or an upvote on this post. Cheems was such a nice and cheerful soul, I loved him dearly and I saw a little piece of myself in him. He was so kind and I am blessed to have been his friend. This just doesn't seem real to me. I had an hour-long phone conversation with him on the 16th right before everything went downhill. I'm so glad I got to have that conversation. I'm glad I got to talk to him just one last time about all the goals he had in life and what was picking at his mind at that particular moment in time. If there is anything I want people to learn from his death it would be to treasure the friends you have in your life and that every decision you make matters. When I went over to his house after he died, it blew my mind to see how many people had been touched by his life. A lot of his family was there and some of the people who knew or were friends of cheems were also there. It's so crazy how just a series of thoughts and one action can affect so many people's lives.  I will never forget Cheems and all that he did for me, I love him with all my heart as he was a one-of-a-kind friend. Thank you all again for remembering Okami Cheems and my condolences go out to everyone that has been affected by his death. Life is worth seeing out to the end and while it may be challenging, those challenges help define us as people and we become an even stronger person as a result of it. I dedicate my life to you Cheems, rest easy soldier.",

Grief is weird, didnt feel real for me for literally months, maybe years, the time is a blur now. Stay strong soldier, try not to blame yourself, no right or wrong way to deal with the emotions you feel now and will feel in the coming months. Sorry for your loss, my DMs are always open if you want to vent or talk about shit.",

I'd heard the stories back at camp. \n\nThe Creek is a cake walk! Plenty of bots falling over themselves to surrender! Every diver there is a legend within a week!\n\nThe reality hit me as soon as the door blew off my pod, green hell all around me, filled with monsters come to life. D2 on my left copped a rocket before he could even pick up his support weapon. We were about to high-five a successful landing, then suddenly I was wiping pieces of him off my visor.\n\nS3 got torn to pieces by some chainsaw wielding monster. I saw the strategic beacon drop from his severed hand in slow motion.\n\nSuddenly it was raining explosions 380mm right on top of us. I was frozen solid in the middle of an apocalypse.\n\nS.A. Okami Cheems hit me so hard I thought it was another rocket. We went down together and suddenly everything was moving at normal speed again. He was shouting something at me but I couldn't hear. He pulled me up and we ran, he had his side arm in one hand and the other on my shoulder, making sure I didn't slow down.\n\nWe kept running at some point I remembered how to shoot again and I added my liberator to our fire power. But he never took his hand off my shoulder.\n\nI don't know how long we were running for, but suddenly everything was quite and I was still alive.\n\nHe was like something straight out of the posters, straight backed and proud. He looked at me and said \"Good job soldier, I couldn't have done that without you.\"\n\nHe. Couldn't have done it without me?\n\nHe saved my damn life!\n\n30 minutes later we were holding off a horde of bots while the extraction shuttle landed. I lost an arm that day, but my new one holds a gun just fine. I would have lost a lot more if it wasn't for Skull Admiral Okami Cheems.\n\nEvery drop I try my damndest to pay it forward to the next young recruit dropping next to me.\n\nRest well sir, you've earned it.",

He was an extremely hard worker, aside from the regular work life he was also semi-pro in the sport he was dedicated to.\n\nOne day he calls me out of the blue (we constantly kept in touch, but usually when we met up in those days it was planned way in advance with his busy schedule) and asked if I wanted to meet at the bar near my place. I did, and we had a great time, stayed out til the wee hours of the morning just shooting the shit. He was his usual super extraverted, happy-go-lucky self. Aside from a couple minor bullshit things at work he didn't say a single thing about any problems in his life.\n\nThe next afternoon I woke up to tons of calls and messages from mutual friends and both his and my family. I called one back and they told me he'd taken his life. I literally couldn't believe it for some time.
