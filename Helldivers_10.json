      "Can’t we all just agree that chargers are annoying as fuck and go from there?",
      "The thing I find the most frustrating with many issues like this is how quickly it devolves into an \"Us Vs Them\" thing. Oh \"they\" are the ones being petty. Oh look how childish \"those\" people are. Pick your team and vilify the others quick, no we won't have reasonable discussion because those people on the other side aren't having it either.\n\nAnd here we find the subreddit breaking down into mass insults and dumb petty comments over... Weapon balancing? Oh dear.",
      "I don't feel anyway in particular about the changes, I do get frustrated when I get called a meta slave though. I just like Railguns and Gauss weaponry okay.",
      "I'm just going to stop checking this sub after patches for a week or two. It's unbearable.",
      "This sub went from \"let's build the most wholesome community\" to \"can we be civil please?\" In one day",
      "It’s funny how any criticism of the patch makes people automatically assume you exclusively use the shield backpack with breaker and Railgun. I’ve been rocking jump pack, dominator, and arc thrower this whole time",
      "I just don't want to deal with 4+ chargers and having to just bring them along everywhere and slowly kill them.",
      "For a game that’s a PvE co-op, the amount of gatekeeping going on is insane.",
      "The biggest issue is the divide between those who frequently play high difficulties (to gather samples, for instance) and those who don't.\n\nThe game is completely different after a certain threshold, with Charger and Hulk spam every breach/airdrop.",
      "Yeah, for me personally, I'm just concerned I won't enjoy the game after a month or 2 of balance patches.\n\nI really liked the power level I had pre nerfs, where I felt like I could take care of myself for the most part, but if I was by myself I could still be overrun and die pretty easily if I wasn't being careful. \n\nNow after the nerfs, if this is where the devs want the power level to be, then there's probably going to be one less Helldiver out there fighting for democracy. \n\nWhich is completely fine btw. I'm not angry at the devs for making the game the way they want it to be. It's just not the game I want it to be, so I won't play it.",
      "I can certainly play without the Rail Gun (I mean I just unlocked it a couple of days ago), but my game this morning wasn't nearly as fun as when the Rail Gun was good.",
      "I dont even use the railgun! I simply believe, on principle, that nerfing the single most popular strategems in the game, not buffing the most useless weapons in the game, and then telling your audience that you want them to use strategems more than their primary weapon is clueless, insulting and silly!!!!!",
      "Baby, real Helldivers only use the senator revolver (ironically it does penetrate certain things considering it's a secondary)",
      "Being called a meta slave when I started playing before any youtube guides were written and I was just using the guns I liked lol.",

      "Needs to come from both sides. Instantly jumping to conclusions without actually trying the patched weapons out in game didn't help either.\n\nThis patch is great and all, but a lot of weapons still need work. Glad the flamethrower got buffed, Las cannon desperately needed the med armor piercing. But no word on other stuff like ballistic shield or jetpack (though I know some people still swear by the jetpack) or the spear's garbage target acquisition and damage. And most of the primaries just suck, frankly. The DMRs, Dominator, Liberator variants, and maybe even Slugger (not sure whether this has been changed).\n\nBut all everyone's been crying about is the railgun nerf, which isn't actually that bad if you've been firing on unsafe mode like you should've been doing from the start since you know better at level 20 when you unlock the damn thing.\n\nReally, just give it a day or two to get used to the damn thing before blowing up the discord. That's about how long you probably took to get good with the weapon in the first place, and should be enough time to realize that everything will be ok.",
      "The game is popular, it’s a numbers game.\n\nLots of neckbeards come crawling out.",
      "I mean, in the drops I've done after the patch I've seen arc throwers, flamers, AMR and spear used widely. Before I saw  90% railgun, which makes everything a little bit more demanding now, but also a bit more fun for me. I for example learned to love the spear, especially against chargers.",
      "I thought a fun PvE game like this might be different from the usual toxicity. Surely people won't get personal over silly shit when we're all on the same team...\n\nI should know better by now. Gamers suck.",
      "The biggest thing I’ve seen is general dissatisfaction with the patch.\n\nPre-patch, I have been trying everything except the railgun because I figured it might get nerfed, but I also figured it was overrated so I wanted to try the other stuff.\n\nAnd here’s the patch, and they nerfed it after all. I found that I really like the Auto Cannon, and the EAT, my old favorite, is still a great option.\n\nI am thrilled they buffed the Punisher shotgun because that was my big wish for the patch. The armor changes are the most disappointing because I think everyone expected a little more. The armor is not looking that effective right now. But it’s only the first balance patch. They can collect data on armor usage and make changes later. Arrowhead has been really quick with patches, and if they keep that up we might see some further balance tweaks sooner than we think.",
      "For real. Nerfing Railgun and breaker actually hurts casual players more than it does meta players imo. Now casuals lose out on a cool option they might have liked and meta players will inevitably find a new meta loadout. \n\nYou can’t let the somewhat niche hardcore meta players alter the direction of the game to such a large degree imo.",
      "You can practically see the stans foaming at the mouth when they defend the patch.",
      "I've been called a mortar farming meta user several times.... I don't even know what the hell a mortar farm is.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c7mjmdx1wumc1.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=11922eaf38112efc4c86d07d5629cebf69602ada",
      "Yeah, it really does seem like the toxicity is coming from those defending the nerfs. \n\nI wonder why?",
      "Yeah, they are like the souls gamers who hated those who uses game mechanics to play the game… same thing here",
      "I wish people would stop going all PVP on this conversation. \n\nIt's obvious people just want some more VIABLE choices. \n\nThat is not impossible.",
      "Disagreeing with some of the patches made is one thing. But people saying the whole game is bad now because they only ever use breaker, railgun and shield pack and they can’t figure out how to use other weapons/stratagems is ridiculous.",
      "So much this it hurts.",
      "People are taking the \"roleplaying\" of fascist bullies a little to seriously.",
      "Breaker is fun and all but I don’t want to deal with a stale meta or a pile of dusty, unused guns in my collection.  Its just not democratic.",

      "Kinda makes me glad I’m so far behind a lot of folks. I only unlocked the Breaker yesterday, and am not high enough level to touch the rail gun or shield pack. Can’t miss what I never had lol",
      "Welcome to the internet where people are shitty regardless of their opinions on any given topic. Try to stay off social media and forums and you should be fine.",
      "I mean the spear or recoilless should be buffed tbh, too many times I just dump round after round into a weak spot and it not register or do anything, especially with chargers",
      "I don't even care that the railgun got nerfed cause I don't use it, I just would like more buffs to c and d tier weapons. Personally every weapon in the game should be viable till at LEAST difficulty 5",
      "Look at the end of the day none of us can do anything to undo the patch, so there's no sense fighting each other over it. It just makes the community more toxic. We got enough bugs and bots to kill, we don't need to turn on each other.",
      "Pretty much this, yeah.",
      "This is way to fucking true in this subreddit rn",
      "when you tried to provide some good buff and nerf and enemies spawn rate being inconsistence but they just reply with \"Skill issues\"",
      "I prefer the slugger to the breaker anyway and the EAT over the railgun but I'm still mad about this patch. So many weapons and stratagems are nearly unusable and, instead of making them better, they chose to gimp the stuff that works?",
      "Railgun users defending railgun users, deep down you know the weapon is busted.\n\nDev realised it too that why nerf is a thing,  just accept the fact and analyst other weapons test it try it please.\n\nStop mocking other shit talking you when railgun users were the one who Mass Downvote people at the first place.",
      "\"See? I depicted you as the obnoxious raven, and myself the reasonable bird, your argument is invalid'\"",
      "I don't know, I've seen more people acting like this is the apocalypse of updates than I have people bullying the first group, and the latter is always down voted to hell.\n\nI want discussions to be more civil too, but it's really annoying to see so many people act like the railgun was the only viable weapon in the game and that a marginal nerf somehow made it worthless.",
      "I like the jump pack",
      "We need higher difficulty options going up to the extremes.  \n\nIf the people screaming \"git gud\" don't play them then they were full of it the entire time. If they do play them and enjoy them then we've solved the issue. If they play them and don't enjoy them then difficulty was never what they were after and they are probably just elitists and can be safely quarantined.",
      "I know right.",
      "I love how devs try not to make the game toxic and about fun but then one patch with slight criticism can split the community like this.\nAlso I have yet to see a good AT option for high difficulty besides the extremely long cool down stratagems",
      "Nerfing the railgun just means everyone gonna be using the autocannon so then THAT will get nerfed",
      "While I understand Op's meme, he/she forgets that this reddit. R/DestinytheGame 's redditors get like this weekly. it's a genuine suprise when when they get wholesome. A salt free subreddit had to be made for Destiny.",

FOR LIBER-TEA!",
      "EAT is actually viable, the cooldown so short you can call 2-3 EATs in the same spot. Just use it to oneshot a charger leg and then mag dump it. To be honest I like these new nerfs because theres more diversity in our loadouts now. But dont worry once we get mechs and new weapons its gonna get easier to handle.",
      "The git gud community is cringe as fuck. The game isn't hard. Once you realize the shift key (or whatever it is on controller) is the strongest weapon of all. You will know people who think you need skill to complete the hardest difficulty consistently are clowns.",
      "I've seen people being way more dickish and hostile toward Arrowhead over the patches than anyone upset about them, so idk chief.\n\nLegitimately, there are entire comment threads in this sub right now where people are starting to cry foul that Arrowhead is incompetent...because they made a genuine balance patch.\n\nThe other thing that's really frustrating is everyone saying they should have buffed other weapons instead of nerfing the most OP options...\n\nDid you guys even read any patch notes!? **That's exactly what they did!** Not only did they not invalidate Railgun's use-case at all because they preserved un-safe mode as-is, there are now 2-3 other options equally as viable as the Railgun that ***absolutely were not before***.",
      "Congrats on contributing to the problem. I love this game, but this subreddit? Bunch of complaining, complaining about complaining, and low-effort memes.",
      "I've seen a lot of insults thrown around, and almost all of them were coming from people angry at the railgun nerfs.",

      "I just think it's fine. IDK. I'm not for one or the other. I just was getting bored of railgun breaker and started using other guns because of it and enjoyed that process. This just takes the stress off of me when we are doing 7, 8, 9s. Don't feel bottled anymore, either, and that's a W for me. We are all different and this isn't the last patch we'll see.

      "I'm in the middle, I'm okay with nerfs and I'm ok with buffs. I like some of the more simple weapons like the assault rifle and love the MG call ins, but the enemies have to change with the weapon changes I think. Can't nerf a good gun but let the hard enemies still swarm you 5v1",
      "Everytime I open reddit, the top post is just a helldivers 2 post fighting the community. I feel like I need to mute this sub now. From day 1 it feels like there's far too many manchildren with nothing to do than play video games 9 hours a day. Go the fuck outside and practice your social skills",
      "Except the first bird isn't talking calmly, and is instead crying about how they can't solo difficulty 7/8/9 with their railgun anymore.",
      "No, we are gamers. This is all that we know.",
      "... so i guess we're on backlash to the backlash to the backlash now?",
      "Thank you for this meme, the amount of people screaming ,,Railgun main, no aim, no brain\" has been... **deafening...**",

      "The crows not wrong lol",
      "Even posts like this contribute towards the Us vs. Them mentality. Knock it off",
      "I think it would be cool if they took a different route for the buffs and nerfs such as a retcon with an optional “upgrade” to change it back to pre update stats. Let’s say you personally think the Railgun isn’t strong enough, that’s fine, just head to the new experimental weaponry development lab on your ship! They have lots on offer such as a new tweak for the Railgun that is played off like a new non experimental version of the Railgun that would have the same damage output and armour piercing capabilities as before. If you’re fine with the new retconned Railgun or don’t want the temptation of always using it then don’t upgrade it. Maybe the engineers can set a secondary objective on your mission log to fire the Railgun in unsafe mode just before it explodes 10 times or something and then you pay for the labour and materials with Req.",

      "helldiver difficulty is totaly unplayable atm... especially with those vomit bugs that instakill you ... titans are immune to everything except stratagems atm...\n\ni wish i had more options in terms of bug control guns ... but they nerfed the only viable gun wich was the breaker... or the other guns just tickle them and since at that difficulty most enemies are chargers, it is just pointless to play unless you got a fetish for dying",
      "Love the changes besides the armor, whoever is balancing armor needs to be sent to the ministry of truth",
      "Normal weapons should be good for the small things with being able to take out a handful of big things using the support weapons. Railgun was, and likely still is (haven’t played myself) good for taking out a handful of chargers or hulks. \n\nHaving other weapons that can do the same is a good spot.",
      "I see these ppl as a loud minority I don't think it's that much of a thing",
      "Oh the meta versus nonmeta versus popular versus just have fun versus toxic versus Reddit...\n\n... Constant discourse has been such a turn off for this sub and myself. The game is amazing and rightfully should be treated that way.\n\nBut y'all are just you.... Maybe they should buff or nerf that huh?",
      "Halving the Ammo on the Railgun would have felt like a better change. \n\nCurrently flamethrower and Big Light Cannon being more usable against armor feels like a strange change. \n\nSince they don't want any primaries to be able to deal with heavy armor. I think the community just needs to accept that no primaries will ever deal with heavy armor and focus on the call in weapon balance.",
      "\"Can we be more civil\" -> Proceeds to straw-man the discussion in order to victimhood the raligun enjoyers.\n\nLet's be honest, both sides are being babies here.",
      "nah mate sry, the people who scream like crazy are the ones complaining about the nerf not the one defending it xD lol you rly just turn the truth on the head here xD  \nyou guys make METACRITIC accounts on mass just to spam 0/10 reviews for the nerf LOL",
      "The community was so much better before we got into the balance debates",
      "Not gonna lie, I don't even primarily care for people to be super nice/respectful (although that should always be a given), at bare minimum I would just really appreciate some intellectual honesty in this community.\n\n# The game is fucking fun.\n\nThat's a given, but the game also isn't the prime \"peak\" of god given balance either. It just isn't, the fact that they had to readjust things already is hopefully evidence enough for even the last person, that this is not a perfectly from the get-go polished title. (This isn't meant as a critique, just that we should not be delusional about the state of it).\n\n**However.** People are also having a conversation of everything getting nerfed, having this pre-formed bias that is just crazy. They buffed (although shadow buffed) rocket launchers (RR/Spear is what I know of), ammo pick ups now resupply the backpack. I believe the supplies also fill up more ammo than before too (when I had like 2-3 shot missing it filled my backpack completely, so maybe it even gives you a full backpack?). This is huge and does a lot for the viability of those weapons.\n\nFor one, I genuinely can't see anyone else mentioning this, I almost feel like I should make a post about it, because word of mouth somehow doesn't seem to kick in? But the notion that everything is getting turbo nerfed is objectively untrue. \n\nHaving said that, yes the devs are also [aware](https://www.arrowheadgamestudios.com/2024/03/balancing-the-firepower-in-helldivers-2/) that people aren't super happy with AT performance and the abundance of heavies. This is being monitored, I know it is not great to play some awful RNG matches right now, but if you get the same tilt you get from League of Legends from a PvE title you might want to consider taking a short break and coming back after a few weeks. That's not to say \"go away, we don't want you\", just that it's literally not healthy for oneself or the community to let that fester. \n\nOn the **other hand** not everyone challenging the design decisions of the devs, disagrees with changes or just in general brings up feedback/critique is somehow \"not good enough\", a \"troll\" ^((tbf I've not seen anyone being called that yet)) or they somehow don't \"understand the devs vision\". In their own way, both things are valid and okay, the only thing we need to do really, is to cease being emotional fucking idiots. \n\nJust go into a conversation assuming the other person legitimately wants to improve the experience in the game, feel free to disagree with them, but appreciate that some takes might have merit, but \"blindly\" believing A or B (either that everything has to be shit or that somehow everything the devs touch is gold) is not the way, that's just incredibly idiotic. Let's not be idiots.\n\nI am very diplomatic.",

Just yesterday we were singing Helldivers' praise, and now we're tearing each other apart.\n\nMaybe I just don't get it because I never used the Breaker or Railgun, since I'm a somewhat new player still. But let's give each other a break and the devs a chance. This update just barely rolled out. The game has been out for less than a month. I'm sure if the results are catastrophic, then the devs will backpedal in a few weeks.",

      "I want to say one thing if I can. It might be me but I still feel the same way with slap on wrist breaker now vs old breaker. They do the same thing but with 3 less bullets. Recoil being higher does make so you can't just hold the trigger but then again we can control our aim. Railgun doing less DMG on safe requires us to do slightly longer charges on unsafe mode which is alright. Takes a brief moment to fire.\n\nI'll start talking if I see something like minus 100 DMG on breaker, but then again, devs wouldn't butcher a weapon like that.",

When the ceo tweeted about giving new players things and helping them people couldn't post fast enough about how we need to be giving everything to new players when I've had plenty of them fuck me over because they don't understand the game and think any time they die to a team mate it's purposeful team killing.

And since they’re so vocal they will heavily retaliate against perceived threats and in a very toxic way too.\n\nThis is why it is so important to look out for people who seem to be a bit too into the super earth rhetoric. It’s perfectly fine to lean into and say stuff like “the ministry of truth will be investigating your for thoughtcrime” as long as you know it’s satire. The people who would get mad when other people got worried that parts of the community were too into the role playing, and were being problematic, were likely making it easier for these fascist  to fly under the radar.\n\nLike I said though I am by no means saying this game supports fascism or that the community is a bunch of fascist. I’m just saying we have to look out for it if we want to keep the community fun and positive while still being able to role play as Democracy bringers.\n\nIf you think I’m being dramatic, look at Warhammer 40K. They had the exact situation and now they are known for having a fascist fan base.\n\nTL;DR: This game inherently opened itself up to a toxic community by being a satire of fascism and people need to look out for them to stop it from getting worse.

Armor scaling. Spawn rates. Cooldown changes. Possible new weapons and strategems and the niches they'd fill. The myriad of non-Terminid bugs. The abysmal state of the itemization system (4 pieces of gear with no stats?). The metanarrative.

Many have commented that they aren’t  powerful enough and are unable to deal with all the enemies either by  the amount of ammunition required or their raw DPS. This is very much  intentional, you need to rely on your Stratagems, and the Stratagems of  your team to deal with all the enemies effectively. Either by Eagle  Airstrikes, Orbitals, Support Weapons, or Turrets, some of your  loadout/team should be tailoring their loadout to killing the weaker  stuff more efficiently.\n\nIf they don't want primary weapons to be our ***primary*** weapons for dealing with regular enemies, then why even have them in the game?  \n\n\n>This doesn’t mean that your primary  weapon shouldn’t feel good to use, but please understand that it is  primary only in the sense that it’s something you always spawn with.\n\nWait, which is it?  They want primary weapons to feel good to use, but they also say it's basically just something we spawn with for the sake of having it and that we should rely on stratagems to deal with everything?  \n\n\nIt feels like there's just this disconnect with Arrowheads idea of how we should be playing, and how they're balancing the game.  They want us to rely on stratagems and support weapons to deal with stuff?  Okay, that's fair.  But that means all the stratagems and support weapons are balanced enough to be useable, right?  \n\n\n...Right?",

They also buffed two strategems that people considered absolute jokes.\n\nPeople are doomposting about the Railgun nerfs and are ignoring that they did actually buff some of the weaker stuff.

Now I'm just running in circles around extract because I know my guns won't be able to take down the Biles.\n\nI don't think 10 head shots to kill a Bile on a 1 round mag charge weapon that carries 20 rounds max is overpowered.  I don't think 2 well placed shots and a whole mag of your primary to kill a charger is overpowered either.  I'm honestly not sure, but maybe people who are playing on difficulty 5 don't understand just how many Chargers and Biles show up on a difficulty 8.

Checked shit out. \n\n\"Well, this isn't too bad\" - \"Oh wow the barrage works now sort of\" -> \"Jesus the flamethrower is strong\" -> \"hold the fucking phone, I can reload my rockets on ammo drops now? That's huge why is no one talking about this\"\n\nNow I'm kind of in a limbo of, well I did like the changes, the RG was overtuned for what it was capable of doing (I feel like people did not appreciate the backpackless, 20 ammo capacity sniper+tank shredder) capabilities. Mind you I also believe the Charger spawns were bugged (it was a bit ridiculous sometimes, like come on that can't be intended to have more chargers than smaller bugs on the screen), but I don't hate the patch, I honestly can't really say that it isn't a step up. Almost everything got buffed and like two things got adjusted/nerfed down.

MMOs also level cap you so when new content drops, everyone can \"grind it together\" if that makes sense?)\n\nTruly the core of the problem I believe is that we simply do not have the content to support the grind you're going for right now, but your dislike of the cap is absolutely valid.

It can already work against Chargers. When this is pointed, people whole \"oh but what about eight Chargers and six Nile Titans that I agroed?\". People want option for rapid fire, EAT can't offer that. So even if we buff EAT to kill chargers in one shot, you still only get two of them, which means people will stick to RG\n\nRecoiless Rifle: RR is as strong as EAT, it's issue is reload time. So people will still stick to railgun because they want rapid fire. Changing solo reload to be much faster takes away from the whole team aspect that it is build around. Also, RR demands backpack, something RG doesn't, so people will stick to RG to get that backpack.\n\nSpear: Same issue as with RR.\n\nAutocannon: RR once again suffers from it's reload time. Sure, you get 10 magazine clip... which takes far longer to reload than RG. It also demands backpack, making RG \"superior\" because you can get shield backpack. Furthermore, AC has strong recoil, unlike RG.\n\nAnti-Materiel Rifle: ARM is already close to RG, just with slightly lower penetration. Giving it heavy armor penetration just turns it into RG, but with faster reload.\n\nTo \"buff\" other weapons you basically have to turn them into RG, which is not buffing them anymore: that's just removing variety.\n\n  \nInstead, they reduced the \"safe mode\" to being able to pen medium armor, making it decent against walkers, hive guards and other \"medium mobs\".

Outshined by far by the other smg, which itself isn't the best but I would accept that it's in a decent state. Why does it outshine all the assault rifles though? Half a mag per trash mob of either faction is not fun on anything challenging or above. I don't think the community pushback is an outright judgment of the breaker and railgun nerf, but highlighting concern that they are more focused on breaking the meta than making the game more enjoyable for alternative play styles. And before you come for my neck my favorite loadout is the scorcher jetpack and stalwart. I'm hardly affected from the balance patch, and am actually looking forward to using the laser cannon now since I think it's the raddest weapon in the game, but they should have done what they did for the flamer and laser cannon to a dozen or more primary/support weapons instead of trying to handicap the meta for sake of handicapping the meta. I also understand they have a vision and more info than us, maybe a lot of these issues we have will be fixed by an update that brings weapon upgrades from the first game back, but that's a lot of hoping and waiting instead of having fun now and nobody likes that shit. ",

People have said games like LoL, MTG, etc are \"dying\" for over a decade at this point and while the game hasn't died, they've effectively created communities for those games that are miserable to interact with because the only popular discourse is nihilism.\n\nThis game is very young and (in my opinion) has a long life ahead of it, but the kinds of discourse we tolerate in the community's infancy will shape the way people talk about this game for years.

With the og rail gun it was sometimes possible to let of two shots before a charge closes the gap from diving behind em and running. That means that before we had a tight window that would sometimes allow for a 1400ms attack to get through (2 safe mode og shots) now you have the same tight window but your single shot is 1200ms sometimes making that shot impossible or in most cases you only get the one shot. Meaning that 3600ms is probably closer to 5000 to 6000ms because you now have to dodge the charger 2 to 3 times  instead of 0 to 2 times. \n\nThis means the railgun is not twice as slow but likely 4 to 5 times as slow.",

      "my grip with the DMR isn't even armor pen, for example, the Dil Counter Sniper has horrible ergonomics even when crouching/prone. the sights seem to be wonky, i have aimed plenty of shots directly at the weakpoint of an enemy only for it to shoot wide of the crosshair, that is ridiculous. i play plenty of hardcore shooters like Squad and Hell Let Loose and their mechanics aren't nearly as fucked as that DMR's. i don't even want it to be able to fuck up super armored enemies, it already fucks up Devestators and hive guard.  \n\n\nnot to mention it's ammo count feels pitiful, but that is really a minor gripe since, on anything 7+ your ammo is going to run dry regardless weapon just because of the sheer number of enemies bearing down on you.  \nif the aiming on a DMR of all things feels jank, that alone can cause people to not want to bring it, since it's supposed to be a high accuracy weapon when you take your time to aim with it from a crouch/prone stance.  \n\n\nand that's just that DMR, never mind the myriad of issues with the other primaries.  \n\n\ntoo many people are getting hung up on the idea that people asking for weapon buffs are wanting some sort of \"melt all death-star esque\" weapon buffs for primaries and everything else. that's not it at all. people want the weapons to not be fucking jank as fuck when plenty of other games can make their game difficult but still enjoyable without some artificial jank fucking with their gameplay.  \n\n\ni don't even care about the Railgun nerfs, it's still viable, i just doesn't have god tier effieciency anymore, boo hoo oh well. the shield still prevents getting tapped with a slow by hunters, and the breaker is still an effective shotgun, despite the DPS loss. unfortunately, a lot of the other weaposn still feel garbage to use, never midn that the Armor \"fix\" actually feels more like a massive downgrade, which im not sure if it's because the armor feels nerfed because it is, maybe? or if it feels nerfed because they turned up the enemy spawns across all difficulties to 11, and fixed the enemy hitscan so that when they hit you with a grazing shot, it actually does damage more often than just being a 0 damage dead hit half the time like it was before.  \n\n\nhope the mechs and other vehicles aren't totally made of butter because otherwise, what the fuck are we even playing anymore for other than to just be one shot by the odd stray enemy bullet/rocket/bug claw for 40 minutes of our fucking time, might as well waste my time on another game that won't piss me off with some dumb shit insta-kill mechanics despite using cover and positioning to the best of my ability, or running my ass off kiting and slowing enemies the best i can just to get one tapped by some little shit bug that slows me just enough for a charger to pile drive me.",

Because the devs have basically created a situation where people will spend 30+ min of time, then lose all the time spent, because other people they have no connection to don't know how to play. \n\nThe games community is 100% a reflection on the devs and the way they have decided to develope the game, and how they decide to moderate the community.",

      "Hunters/Stalkers are honestly great, they are super annoying but I feel like they are the exact threat they are supposed to represent. But a Charger (without the Railgun) is such an obstacle already, I see people showing \"tricks\" (let's be real, it's probably an exploit, when they suddenly lose their armor during an animation and a pistol kills them on the front leg) of handling them, but you having to dodge them in the first place is already a job well done. \n\nIf you are in medium/heavy armor, you are already losing stam now, losing tempo with getting up and once the small shit pounces on you it's gg - now this scenario but you have at the very least 5 chargers on screen - you cannot ever hold a position due to the nature of chargers and IMO when I can't use AT to take them out from the front kind of reliably, then clearing them with some dodges isn't exactly a fix - because them getting me out of position is a win for them.\n\nNow it is their job to do so of course, I get that. But they are too good at it or the tools to counter that aren't reliable enough (aside from the RG which let's you be mobile during breaking the armor off). When I compare it to what tanks do on the bot side, it's not even on the same level. -- But yeah, I feel like the Hunters work as intended, but our armor somehow doesn't (unless it's their fun design decision that a single hunter can \"crit\" down a heavy weapons guy quite quickly).",
      "I'm sorry man, but mass Chargers is just what the game was always intended to be at the top difficulty.  There's a slight issue in that there need to be primaries that contribute against such a foe, but HD1 at the highest difficulties often devolved into me and my friends going full heavy arty load outs and just plastering our vicinity 24/7.",

When people start out (1-3) they should have tools that help teach them the game. At (4 - 6) people are exploring mechanics and trying new things and strategies. This is where the vast majority of the playerbase are going to be, the casual scene. 7 is the end-stop for casual players; if they really want to upgrade their ship completely (which is an optional task), 7 is where super samples can be found. 8 and Helldive are for hardcore players. They dont provide and particular mechanical benefits beyond 7. These levels are for polished teams and those looking to run and run until they finally get a successful evac.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased on the patch, dev commentary and previous title (HD1), it seems like theyre sticking to their core game concept pretty closely. Helldive is absolutely not for everyone, and shouldnt be balanced to cater to everyone.  \n\n\nYou tagged \"the game needs more weapon diversity\" at the end; absolutely. All games would probably benefit from more diversity and room for creativity. The current set of weapon are able to perform and be fun, just not at the uppermost, hardcore, sweaty levels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are 9 difficulties for a reason.

Per campaign you get 21 medals on lvl6 difficulty. Meaning that it would take you roughly 55.5 hours to get 1k medals, with only game time and excluding loading and crashes and etc.   \n\n\nTo do the same but taking the full time of every mission takes only 48(47.97) hours to reach 1k medals running Helldives. It is just far more effective at gaining medals without relying on RNG.   \n\n\nDo you see the issue here?",

It's all good that you prefer the concept of the hardest being the most fun; there are others like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrying to say that the game structure would benefit from making all guns more powerful is something else entirely. No one is forcing you to play difficulty 9 and having a bad time other than yourself. Perhaps try high difficulty levels instead of Helldives and see what that feels like before looking at the patch notes again. A lot of people who (claim) to play Helldives exclusively are saying it is too difficult and too restrictive. This is a valid claim, just one that shouldnt be fixed by flattening the weapon viability (Affecting all difficulties below). The game can be fun if you let it.",

Wtf.\n\nWe just figured ya unlocked planets close to others in the same sector or after so many in the same sector were taken. I’d say most if not all players on creek right now have the same idea, it’s not their fault and a clearer UI design similar to the 3rd party site would help. If there’s 70k people on creek, most likely thinking it’s helping the major order in some way when in actuality it isn’t, I think that’s a sign of bad conveyance intentional or not by the devs. Just use a dotted line, shows they’re connected both ways and isn’t too visually noisy.",

And if we capture it, it lets us attack any of the others that we *don't* control.\n\nThis has become a big point of drama over the last couple days because people not understanding it set us up to fail the major order. We have to liberate Tibit, and to reach it, we have to take Ubanea first. But part-way through the liberation of Ubanea, the automatons launched a counterattack on Draupnir, the planet letting us access Ubanea in the first place. So if/when Draupnir fell, we wouldn't be able to attack Ubanea anymore.\n\nThe community was split on whether we should immediately defend Draupnir, or just rush to finish capturing Ubanea. That split lead to us doing neither. Ubanea was 95% liberated when Draupnir fell, cutting off our ability to finish it off, and forcing us to retake Draupnir from scratch while Ubanea's liberation % slowly decayed in the background.\n\nSince then though, only ~60% of the forces on the automaton front have actually been recapping Draupnir. The other 40% are screwing around on Malevelon Creek, either just for the meme, or because they don't realize it DOESN'T connect to Ubanea and taking it is pointless.\n\n\nEDIT: Draupnir was finally retaken while I was typing this. Now we have access to Ubanea again. Its Liberation % dropped from 95% to 83% in the time it took us to regain Draupnir.\n\nMeanwhile, there's STILL more people on Malevelon than Ubanea. SMH.",

The best I can come up with is a standing system that tracks players' participation and hands out a new cosmetic once a month to players who have a certain ratio of matches played in major orders.

It was meant to be an equally simple suggestion. Yes, your idea likely would be better and more enjoyable, it would also be much harder to implement in any timely manner, plus the part of \"what rewards to put into it\". The devs are pretty against limited time rewards and fomo, so having something like armor tied to a specific major order would not be something they'd do unless it gets reused in other major orders, at which point what do the people who already have it get? Major orders really arnt long enough to have any substantial rewards tied to progression inside of them, unless it's a like, separate thing that progresses regardless of which major order you participate in, which is just a reskinned warbond.\n\nI think it can easily be simplified though, like for example, participating in missions related to the major order give twice as many medals for completing them.",
      "90% of the player base can’t complete a PO every day. We have jobs and families and shit to do that isn’t gaming. \n\nIt takes two seconds to search “level cap” on here, but here you go:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/s/l9dG0vC9fx",
      "I have to say I completely disagree with you. I have just under 100 hours in the game and I still don’t have the third battle pass unlocked nor the other two fully finished. EXP obviously I don’t care that much about but with *more* battle passes coming ostensibly every month, rewarding players with more medals seems like a no-brainer.",
      "I only play on 9, for the medals",
      "im mean not in this case, arrows indicate we can go only in one direction but here it works both ways",
      "You contradict yourself \n\n> Yes but we started losing it because it wasn't held. That is why it stopped at 95%. Which split the player base. \n\nImplies that we lost Ubanea because Draupnir fell which is only half true, the playerbase was also already split at this point which lead to Ubanea being cut off.  If the people on defence was on attack then Ubanea is liberated and Draupnir can fall with no concequence.  If the people on attack went to defend they we might of held Draupnir and the connection.  Draupnir falling was the consequence, not the reason.",
      "You already need to hover to select a planet, both methods are valid, but the one in the video could become overwhelming information if they are always shown and especially if there are a lot of lines.  \n\n\nWith the hover, you show information as they become relevant (i.e selecting a planet for your mission) and it kinda integrates into the current process of mission select. Perhaps we could have faint lines when not hovering and more \"active lines\" like in the video whilst hovering.  \n\n\nAdditionally, not all players would want all that extra information. Putting it behind an extra step for more advanced players or more involved players is not that big of a hurdle, but I believe that a seamless intergration is better because supply lines are kinda essential to the war effort.",

      "Yes, most players not knowing about supply lines is a part of the point I was making. \n\nThe devs may add visible supply lines, sure. But the game has been out for a minute. It clearly isn’t their top priority. Which leads me to believe they’re using it as a way to manipulate the story with the way it is now. \n\nGiven how well the studio has done with the game so far, I doubt they would make such a huge oversight by mistake. I believe it’s more likely to be a feature they are holding off on implementing in order to take advantage of the opportunities it offers for story development.\n\nBut maybe I’m giving them too much credit! Who knows.",
      "No there isn’t. Go look at Creek (or any bug planet) right now, there’s no reticle over it.",

      ">The trees help stealth players.\n\n\nI'm not so sure about that. I play a fair amount of stealthy solo runs and I haven't been convinced that physical obstructions actually inhibit enemy detection. You can get surprisingly close to them while prone even in open terrain. But once they've noticed you I've seen bots track where I am through a whole ass mountain.",
      "at what difficulty ?",
      "That is not a confirmation, see the headline?\n\nDoesn't matter, you can do half the PO or less and you'll still passively unlock warbonds. The players that already play less have a incentive to do major orders with the medals rewards, the people that play a lot have not.",
      "You may well be right. \n\nThere are multiple major orders a week, though, and it's not even been two months. In another three months, everyone who participated in orders would have everything. You get so many medals once you hit challenging that there would be no more need to play orders to stay caught up unless they scaled the cost of the warbond items, and if they do that, what's the point?",

      "The first one where you get super samples.",
      "Bro.. How obtuse can you be? That’s a dev saying “keeping the level cap at 50 is not plausible or likely” and you’re acting like it’s random speculation 😆 \n\n>the players that already play less have an incentive in the major order medals\n\nYes.. which obviously isn’t working as shown by the fact that we have failed multiple major orders due to people a) not understanding supply lines (unnecessary obfuscation) and b) not having any major incentive when everybody gets the medals even if they didn’t participate.",
      ">In another three months, everyone who participated in orders would have everything \n\nNo, because in another 3 months, there will be another 2-3 battle passes.",
      "This is whats confusing to me. Creek is in the same sector as Daupnir and Tibit. It makes the most sense to attack a planet that comes before the one we want, which at this point is Daupnir. The game needs to make a clear notice of what is important to the progression so players can prioritize.",
      "Bugs are terminids. Also, no way people don't have the brain capacity to think \"most players are in this sector so the major order should be there, just gotta find a planet. it's locked? that's probably because we haven't taken the previous ones\"",
      "It is speculation, because it's not a confirmation nor denying the fact that level cap will increase. Why don't you make a post telling everyone it's confirmed that level cap increases by AH? becuase you can't, hence the headline in OG post.\n\nSo your original idea of just increasing rewards isn't gonna cut it since you now pull in other things that wasn't in the discussion in the first place?",
      "Right, but once the f2p and premium passes are complete, staying caught up will be easy with no participation in orders. Look, I'm done here. I'm participating in a good faith discussion and doing so respectfully. Y'all are downvoting me because you disagree with me, which is not the purpose of that button.",
      "Not for nothing, but Draupnir and Malevelon Creek are in two separate sectors.  Ubanea and Malevelon Creek are in the same sector, though.",
      "How are supposed to know which one is the previous one when we're unfamiliar with the system, there's barely any indication, the fleet is divided etc...\n\nPlenty of people probably genuinely thought Malevelon Creek was useful. Plenty of people didn't have the required informations to know what were the differences between taking Ubanea or Draupnir, **because the info *isn't* in the game.**",
      "If you honestly think that a dev outright saying twice in a message that not increasing the level cap is unlikely and not plausible then either you’re seriously moronic or you’re not arguing in good faith. \n\nSupply lines are the point of the entire post, so that’s not bringing in anything that hasn’t been discussed, and the major incentive would be additional medals and exp, as I previously stated. Please just stop replying.",
      "Nice one dumbass",
      "I haven’t pressed the downvote button once lol, people just disagree with you.\n\n>Once the F2P and premium passes are complete, staying caught up will be easy with no participation in orders\n\nWhere is this coming from? As I said, I’m around 100 hours and I don’t have the current 3 complete. I likely won’t have enough SC to get the third battlepass until *after* the next one comes out. And then I’ll have to get SC for that one, and then the next.",
      "Yes, my bad I meant to say Ubanea instead of Daupnir.",
      "If ubanea was available, as it's the closest planet to tibit, you'd think that if we took ubanea we could get access to tibit. I agree that the supply lines should be shown, but people act like they can't think for themselves if there's not a massive red circle with an arrow pointing to where they should attack",
      "Rent free",
      "Right, under the current system. If you got, say, 200 medals twice a week for major orders, you would already be done with them. Honestly, what about a warbond specifically for people who participate in the orders?"

I don't want to try and gatekeep shit but I'm also not trying to babysit randoms. If you're friends carried you through the difficulties then play with them on the higher difficulties.  \n\n\nIf you're AFK I'll give you a minute or 2, message your and try to talk to you and if I get nothing back, you're getting the boot.

      "I recently got kicked for team killing.\n\nI put my sentry down, teammate looks at it then runs off towards the direction of enemies. My turret cuts him in half. Right after respawning, I just see at the side of my screen this lad running up to knock me down and put holes in my rag doll. \n\nI ask why all that and get told I'm being toxic and got kicked.",

I feel like most players understand that contribution is mostly skill-based.\n\nI definitely wish you could get the third tier samples from lower difficulties though (even if they only have a rare rate from the \"cache\" POIs). I feel like I belong on diff 4-5 at my skill level, but I also want to progress so I really have no choice but to go higher.",

I don’t really mind because I can clear a challenging (my go to difficulty) by myself but understand that your guard dog that you refuse to take off just called in half a dozen bug breaches it’s gonna take me a second to clear the area.",
      "Post patch I’ve noticed kicking has been so much more common it’s awful , even at level 30 it’s very common and not even on the super upper tier difficulties",

We really enjoy being pleasantly surprised when we get an awesome random in your team. Even if you make \"poor\" choices (in our opinion, of course) we will play out the entire match with you.  We only ever leave a random (as long as they are trying, aren't team killing, etc) when we get back to the ship.\n\nIf you are a new player, a couple words of advice:\n\nFirst, if you bring turrets or mines, be really mindful about where you place them.\n\nSecond, just because a patrol is tagged, doesn't mean we want to attack it.  Watch your team and engage or disengage with them.",

      "Need more context, What difficulty are you playing at?",
      "Play alone as a new player. The first difficulties are not hard enough to require a team. This will also force you to not rely on others to succeed. I started this way and I’d argue i’m (lvl 18) better than most people lvl 20-40. As well it will rank you up to the point that you’ll be accepted into parties without getting kick (60% of the time)\n\nBut regardless I don’t see lvl 8 as low. I was doing suicide as a lvl 9 no issues. Last case scenario just host a game for others",
      "What this game really needs is the kind of community in Warframe where helping out new players is just another aspect of being a veteran of the game.",

      "I'm level 26 and was kicked from a level 8 difficulty because I decided to go find the uranium purple samples. I got them. All by myself. Sure you can say I purposely went solo but I literally had the samples. Don't know if the group extracted with the 5 samples I got but I'm mad because again that's 5 purples that's absolutely needed",

      "I’m nearly lvl 25 and I still have this issue some people just want more mates with everything unfortunately",
      "I had to kick a level 42 cus we would drop the super rare samples on extract and he kept picking them up and taking them with him",
      "Happens to me at level 15 on suicide mission difficulty still despite the fact that I’ve completed many missions at that level and above up to helldive. People just assume that below level 20 at high difficulty automatically means you’re dead weight or something, it’s annoying.",
      "I like playing with low levels lmao. Dudes don't know shit yet and are crazy af",

      "There is a part of me that wishes if you kick someone who quick played in within 30 seconds of them joining, that the game would disband the host's party/game and make them watch a video tutorial of how to set matchmaking to friends only. After the video would be a quiz starting with \"What was the opening line to this tutorial?\" or something equally asinine where being wrong would make you watch the video again.\n\nThere'd be no test after the second watch, but your match making would be auto set to friends only.",
      "Easy way to get this dealt with is they need to introduce a feature where if the extract has been called either by a player or the forced one right on the time limit, party leader is unable to kick people then once you are all at the end mission scene, they can they be given the ability to kick people again.  \n\n\nIt's really not a hard thing to fix with wasting peoples time.",
      "During my first few levels, can confirm this was the case for me, too.\n\nThe Dwarves were more welcoming, even if perhaps drunk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurther proves my point we need a bar on our Super Destroyer.",
      "Yup. If you’re low level finding a quick match is a pain.",
      "I’m level 21 and I am just happy when someone joins my game.",

      "I do the opposite. I am overjoyed to have a level 5 join my group of 30s because most of the time the clutch is real for them. They are hyper vigilant and although they don't have much in the way of equipment, they make up for it in pure creativity.\n\nI will never forget the chinese level 6 I had that absolutely tanked 5 bile titans with a single 500kg, then somehow survive and extract with 20 samples.",

      "I only had a bad experience with a new player so far... Dropped into a quick match difficulty 7. I spawn in and use my rail cannon strike to kill the titan that was harassing the group. Immediately get team killed on purpose. Like the person is just unloading their primary into me with nothing else around.\n\nI ask \"why tk\". They call me a bitch and blame me for summoning the titan. He also proceeds to follow me around in a mech acting like he's gonna shoot me.\n\nThis level 12 dude proceeded to die 12 times and burn up the reinforcements... \n\nLuckily it was the only bad experience I've had but it made me stop playing for the day.",

      "Level 30 here, i dont care about the difficulty, the level of my teammates is irrelevant to me. Sometimes i prefer lower level teammates because they do funny shit",
      "Dude what is happening to this game right now. People are quitting games left and right just because we die a few times, literally. We lose a couple lives and they bail.  Do they know what game this is? Between that and the kicking, wtf",

Every other time was bc I was logging off, and didn't want them waiting for me to spend my credits n shit just to watch me log off after. \n\nI will not kick someone while we are actively on a mission unless they're intentionally sabotaging us, and intentionally means intentionally, if someone drops a stratagem and I run into it, that's on me, and I haven't had to do this yet.\n\nNor do I kick someone while we are progressing through missions, I log off after we finish our third mission and people get their bonus credits for finishing all three, and only kick if you are causing all of us to wait for too long (5 minutes is about my rule, enough time to take a quick shit and grab snacks and a water).",

      "A lot of people get pissed at the smallest thing. Accidentally team kill one time? Kick.\n\nHalf the time these fools walk into an active stratagem themselves. Or don't back up enough to avoid it.\n\nOr get mad when you can't reinforce fast enough because a charger is eating your ass. Or when you are able to throw a reinforce, but there's no good safe spot because you're backed into a corner with a dozen baddies in front of you, so you chuck it. Then they complain that you dropped em right next to a flame robot or whatever.\n\nOr they can't comprehend that you need to shoot yourself out of a situation and reload before safely calling in a reinforce.\n\nHalf the fun in the game is the absolute chaos. Some people take it too seriously.",

Every now and then, low levels will pop up. We call them puppies and we take them on adventures on diff 4-5.

So I'm like \"fine I'll do it myself.\"\n\nI stealth/run my way towards the heavy outpost, occasionally going prone to sneak by diving. Right before I get to the outpost, I come across the super samples rock!! So I ping it.\n\nNo response from the others.\n\nI ping the super uranium itself and type in chat \"found the super samples!\"\n\nNo response.\n\nWhatever, I grab them, run to the outpost, and throw in an orbital laser. It burns up 5 factories and at the same time they blow up the light outpost! Perfect. Mission complete.\n\nExcept we have two minutes left.\n\nSo I ping the extraction zone and start stealthing my way way there. By the time I get there, there's a minute left so I call in extraction and call in a mech.\n\nWell, two randomly spawned patrols take notice of me and start assaulting my position. I hop in the mech and burn ammo trying to kill all of these bots.\n\nThe bots call a drop ship, two dropships come in and drop off hulks and I'm like \"JESUS CHRIST.\" Still no sign of backup from the three others.\n\nI burn through all of the mech ammo and have to hop out. I proceed to fight for my life, burn through all my stims, all my grenades, consume two supply backpack slots for more stims. I still have all three super samples. The mission timer runs out.\n\nFinally the pelican shows up, blows up some bots as it lands, it triggers the final 20 seconds for anyone to board, and I flick my camera around to see the other three guys are still a mile away?!?\n\nWHATEVER. WE NEED THESE SUPER SAMPLES. I make a break for the pelican as I stim myself again, get right to the platform\n\nAnd I'm booted back to my own ship with the message \"You have been kicked\"\n\nWHY. FOR WHAT. THEY DIDN'T EVEN GET TO PICK UP THE SUPER SAMPLES. THERE WAS 10 SECONDS LEFT TO BOARD THE SHIP AND THEY WERE HALFWAY ACROSS THE MAP\n\n![gif](giphy|p8Uw3hzdAE2dO)",

There's plenty of reasons to not buy this game at the moment (bad server problems, PR blowups from developers, updates that seem to largely ignore player feedback as part of a general 'we know better than you' attitude), but toxicity in game isn't all that bad an issue.\n\nFor everyone who comes on here to complain that someone kicked them from a group, there's probably 1000 players who have had no issues (well, except bugs and server crashes...). I'm currently stepping away because of the problems I mentioned above... but even I, as a vocal critic of the game, will admit that I have had nearly zero problem encounters after a hundred or more hours of playtime.\n\n(Full disclosure: I'm on PC and turn cross-play off. It may be possible that these toxic players that people keep talking about that I never seem to see are exclusively on PS5s, but that probably isn't likely. A percentage of the population are crummy, no matter which hardware they're using.)",

With only 4 slots there's just too many other better stratagems imo. I still take out the orbitals sometimes on low difficulties anyway because they look cool and it's nice when you get a direct 380 on a group but it's still been very unreliable for me despite the decreased radius.",

That can only be mitigated if changes are communicated well and at least factor in concerns of reasonable community members. Than the majority will come out and defend changes they wanted.  \nHere, nobody asked for any of it. The biggest changes weren't even documented and even the reasonable people come out and say the game feels unfair instead of fun. It was just an objectively bad patch with a slow reaction from the developer.  \n\nWorking in Software this result is really obvious as well. The launch went way too big. There are always technical issues after a launch and here there had to be more. They have Server performance problems that are generally hard to deal with. They have a content patch in the pipeline (mechs, warbond). The game is a month old. How could anyone have time to test sweeping AI/Enemy changes? Throwing those out there was absolutely unnecessary and is risking the ongoing success of the game. The reasonable reaction is to be concerned and not to defend those descisions.",
      "This is also a style of game where it's very easy to vastly overestimate your skill level.\n\nThere's no competition. It's co-operative and extremely easy to get carried *hard* without being aware of it. You have to dig for the stats and they're not super helpful. You can *super* easily convince yourself that your 20 bug kills and 8 deaths were okay because you called down some guns, threw down an airstrike, and threw out a few respawns.\n\nThen the game gets patched to get harder and suddenly you're struggling in missions where you used to just fly through it so you come here and *scream* that it must be the game is unfairly hard, not that it used to be too easy and you just suck.",
      "So this is due to a bizarre design decision on the PS5 where our controllers have mics on them and the those mics default to open. Meaning a ton of players join matches and broadcast their delightful household soundtrack of dogs barking, kids crying, parents yelling, etc and have no idea they're shitting up the comms unless they notice their sound icon popping up in the HUD.",
      "#Nintendo64",
      "I keep seeing people say these huge changes that happened in the recent patch made the game way harder, and I have yet to experience it. Everyone points me to a single screenshot of someone saying they'll look into the spawn rates, but that isn't some smoking gun. It's not really proof. Do you have something else that I'm missing?",
      "It's mostly anecdotal for sure, but we don't have any hard numbers on any enemies in this game, so there is nothing else. That's one of the problems with it. I'd accept a git-gud argument if there was a metric.  \nBut I believe there is some official communication that they will reduce spawn rates, mainly heavy-armor spawn rates, in an upcoming hotfix. There has to be a reason for that and it's not that \"the unsafe Railgun is just as good as the old save one\".\n\nFor me and the two friends I usually play with it's several things:  \n- we play mostly Terminids and we talked about the game doing a great job of seeming overwhelming, but still being manageable. You could make a comeback, you could usually clutch it out. We don't \"feel\" that way anymore.  \n- We used to play on 7 and managed, now, after two very frustrating evenings, we dropped down to 5 in spite of needing the 3rd upgrade material. There is talk that maybe the game has run it's course of fun for a week. (Again a feelings thing, but \"fun gameplay\" is a feelings thing and there usually is a rational explanation for that, even if it is not factually clear.) If a group of players considers dropping the game because of a patch and are left guessing what's their problem with the patch, then that's a very bad patch in my book.  \n- Hunters were a huge problem. They spawned in large packs and seemed faster. We used to say that no enemy can harm you if you just run (except stalkers). Now Hunters were hacking at our heels and needed immediate attention.  \n- Stalker used to two-shot, now they one-shot (at least in 7). That's a huge difference as getting killed and getting your gear back is a huge downtime.  \n- Chargers were a problem. I used to two-tap them with the railgun, announce the leg, and they got focused down. That's no longer possible. I even tried a Railgun overcharge Macro for perfect safe overcharge - it's too slow to keep up and not usable once you start to get overwhelmed. We tried to adjust with a Flamethrower but that means Chargers are in our midst and if they don't go for the one with a Flamethrower that's chaos. Next adjustment try would be disposable Rockets.  \n- even in 5 it's common to be engaged with 3+ Chargers at the same time. I don't recall that being the case as we started. Would have been a huge problem then too before unlocking a pre-nerf Railgun.  \n- This evening with 2 players on 5 I had a killcount of ~550 in an open map mission. That used to be ~300-350.  \n- it's probably componding. Chaos because of Chargers and Hunters and deaths means more Breaches means more Chargers and Hunters. So the game feels less Serious Sam and more tactical shooter to never letting it get out of control. The chance of a comeback is greatly reduced.  \n\n  \nThe last point is probably the most important. We play after work and want to kill a few bugs without thinking about it too much. It's fun if you are forced to play you A-game once in a while and clutch out. It's not desirable to have to plan a game like a Rainbow 6 Mission. If that is your style you might not encounter issues. If you had fun with a silly death here or there, it's far less forgiving.  \nWith us it's clearly a skill and adjustment issue - or even an attitude issue. But that comes back to designing a fun game. I haven't heard of any good players being bored out of the game before. Changing this no-Problem to skill-checking out a part of the playerbase is in my subjective opinion \"objectively\" a bad decision by the devs.   \nI wouldn't even care if being skill-checked out of a part of the progression we used to get wasn't such a downer. It is my honest opinion that at least 50% of the hate would disappear if one single purple upgrade mat would spawn beginning at 4 or 5. Then difficulty would be a choice - now it isn't.",
      "I don't really agree with any of your gameplay points. Your opinions on fun can be totally valid though. I think probably a happy middle ground, since I enjoy the higher difficulties and you guys just find it frustrating is to maybe have the rarest samples be purchasable at a poor transaction rate for lower rarity samples. That way you can play whatever difficulty you want without being locked out of upgrades."

      "“I want fewer armored bugs to show up“\n\n*A single finger on the monkey’s paw curls inward*",
      "They pop off nicely with autocannon.",
      "Lmao I noticed this too. Time to start bringing Nade Launcher again",
      "I’m spewing my part. - Bile spewer probably",
      "Bile spewers have less hp than chargers at least, i could easily mow them down with an MG or flamethrower. But i still dont get how in the hell can this FAT FUCK even manage to outrun me as well as be extremely quiet while doing so.",
      "Screw those things.. actually hate them more than the chargers.. Chargers dont istakill you most of the time are are almost easier to dodge. These fuckers also snipe you across the map with one hit if they want to..",
      "The impact grenade in my pocket:",
      "I’ll bring the Recoilless Rifle if you bring the Autocannon.",
      "I fucking hate those thing. The thing I hate the most is that they turn their heads and spew at whatever direction you move to. If they could only spew in one direction, I'd be so happy but I feel like it's iindof nitpicky at this point. ",
      "I've been in the minority here but I would, especially now with AT buffs, much prefer more chargers over bilespewers I hate them so much",
      "my only problem with these tubby lil guys is that there is no way to know if a mission is going to have them or not.",
      "Having 10 of these things is much much worse than 10 chargers man",
      "Man these guys are worse, not because they're hard to kill. But because they kill you in 1 hit. Oh, and they're more silent than a Catholic priest sharing a cab with Chris Handson from dateline NBC.",
      "I don't like Bile Spewers for one absolutely indirect reason.\n\n\nIgnoring all the crap with one shot kills from their sneak attacks.\n\n\nThey are numerous and they are big. And those big bugs end up blocking vision and your shots as they lay dead. You've killed them and they are STILL a problem. Because little bugs hide behind them and you can't see them. And if it's those tiny ranged ones. They'll shoot through them whilst you can't shoot through them back.",
      "I hate these things more than Chargers, this has been the worst trade deal.",
      "Whoever said Chargers would spawn less was lying. They still spawn in hordes, fighting like 4-6 at a time.",
      "I swear I got killed by random ass artillery (pun intended) like 6 times last mission I did (dif 7) and before the patch I, at most, got knocked around cause it landed close. they stealth buffed the aim of these guys or something and they need to stop stealth buffing shit if that the case, also WHY ARE THERE 50 HUNTERS HERE NOW???",
      "Bile Spewers: exists\n\nMission Control: \"warning you are in range of enemy artillery!\"\n\ndivers: \"but we're on a bug planet!\"\n\nMission: \"yep, and you're about to wish you were back at the creek.\"\n\n\\*a barrage that puts even the new 380mm to shame rains down upon the squad, killing them all\\*",
      "Seriously how to effectively deal with these guys?  \n\nSee some videoes said their real weakness is head, but it's like all primary weapon not good at hitting it.  \n\nThey're VERY resilience to fire so flamethrower enjoyer are having hard time against them.  \n\nHeard they're weak against explosive, grenade I want to preserved for nest tho.  \n\nAutocanon is good, but that's specific build for me becausef it eat backpack slot.",
      "TBH I didn't super mind the Titans compared to Chargers.",
      "Stalwart eats good on these nerds, quick 1150 brrrrt in the face, and they're cooked.",
      "There are even more Hunters now",
      "How are they so quiet????????\n\n(Says my melting face)",
      "Into the ➡️➡️➡️ grave they go.",
      "Easy pickin’ for the grenade launcher",
      "I would much rather deal with a swarm of chargers than a swarm of these",
      "NOT AGAIN",
      "Grenade Launcher Gang rise up!",
      "It’s the hunters that scare me",
      "*i turn around and see a dozen donkeys marching my way*",
      " Bile spewers i can handle. Couple autocannon shots puts them down quick. With the limited armor penetrating options, chargers were especially a pain in the ass to put down.",
      "im just happy that the Chargers can be killed easier now tbh couldnt care if there are more smaller enemies those are simple to deal with. I just hope they also fixed the bot spawn rate as well cause thats pretty insane atm",
      "Impact grenade to brrrr",
      "The age of charger is over the time of the bile spewer has come",
      "Acid shit shell INCOMING!",
      "Been saying this since day one. Would rather deal with 5 Chargers than 5 Bile Spewers",
      "I can two tap those babies with my trusty grenade launcher so it’s all good baby 😎",
      "I legitimately have not noticed any decrease in spawn rates at the difficulties they mentioned. My friends and I have been playing difficulty 7 for a few hours and we are still fighting multiple Bile Titans and chargers at the same time, now with even more vile spewers to top it off.\n\nWe're not even mass kiting them into multiple patrols.",
      "Thankfully i found out by accident returning from the Creek with my previous loadout that Scorcher eliminates bile spewers and it feels so damn good.",
      "Bile speakers were worse than Chargers.",
      "I love when the bullet sponges snipe me with insta-kill juice",
      "My grenade launcher is more than happy with this increase in its favorite food.",
      "Grenade launcher goes boom",
      "the hunter spawn rates are actually way too much",
      "I'll be ok looking at the sky, watching Bile mortars like rainfall.\n\nIt's very cinematic that way.",
      "Impact nades and grenade launcher is great for these guys",
      "AMR’s time to shine, hit the upper armor plate on their forehead and they go down in 1 hit.",
      "Hot take: I'd have been fine with the charger quantity if they gave us the one-shot-kill hitbox.",
      "I swear these dude should die much easier with a regular slug shotgun than they do",
      "Don't forget the orange drink.",
      "I would like to see more of those green ones and have them stay away and shoot from their phat asses rather than being chased by them and getting sprogged on.",
      "The best opponent of my flame thrower 🔥",
      "I’m in the minority but I like fighting spewers. I’ve gotten pretty good at staying just outside their range and popping them like pimples.",
      "Yeah heroically bombing the final pack of these fucks with my impact grenades as I’m cooking to death in acid, only to have the fucking silo fail at 95% because of a meteor storm, really put me in a fuck this mood tonight.\n\nAnd if I could get a group that would take EMS mortars and stop shooting the silos, I’d be sooo happy.",
      "*Opens case* \"Ole' Reliable\" *pulls out grenade launcher*",
      "More Hunters then 😨",
      "These dudes are fucking horrible. They should be a long range glass cannon, not a BS bullet sponge. The player gets no reward for flanking them and shooting them in their glowing green ass.",
      "I’m more worried about the hunters bro",
      "Considering they have a ranged attack, I call bullshit on how fast the big spitters/spewers can move.",
      "OK, serious question. Did they add the bug butt artillery after luanch, I swear the first few tines I played the spewers never used butt bombs.",
      "I pray that the game cant handle anymore hunters than it spawning.",
      "INB4 “The Bile Spewer spam is ridiculous, how am I expected to solo on Helldive when I have to use my situational awareness to avoid dangerous bugs?!”",
      "I'll still take it, at least they die to a single impact grenade or a few shots to the face",
      "I feel sometime even you dive. They aim track you and still kill you. SPECALLY when the tiny version aim bot, slow you for 5 sec across the map. \n\nI pretty much hate those spitting fucker. Specifically since the head of thr big one are well protected and leg aren't such a weak spot",
      "So weird question. I like the game like any non-traitor would, but isn't it... weird how little bug variety there is? You'd expect that with a universe for them to evolve in, there would be more than just the few we see. Weird isn't it?",
      "Naaapalm sticks to Nids! Napalm sticks to Nids!",
      "It's been random, but I've had some games on 6 difficulty or higher where it's pretty relaxed because you get dinky little bugs mostly and the occasional Bile Titan or Charge, but then I have had one or two where it's a horde of armored Bile Spewers. They're worse to deal with than 2 chargers at once.",
      "I’ll deal with them happy but 20 hunters and 50 bouncers it got worst for me",
      "GL plus resupply backpack ..... the ultimate bug crowd control gear, two shots bile spewers",
      "For real. Sneaky lil mfs.",
      "Looks like reaper from ME\n\n:D",
      "Bile Spewers are the single type of bug I have massive problems with. Even the tongues have the courtesy to die after after a blast of birdshot to a touch from my libertythrower",
      "I do thoroughly enjoy this more but since minimizing charger's head hp I feel like they cut the armor down by 2/3s  \n1-2 extra chargers than we have right now in diff7-9 would be more than doable   \nhigher diff just feels breezy  \nalso i pray to god they stop double dipping adjustments  \nwe got weakened and less chargers and i think its too much just as last patch before this we got more armor and broken spawn rates with less viable anti heavy.  \nI get balance can be a triangle but there's no reasons to go so hard in both directions and they've done this twice now...",
      "They don’t spawn more.  The game is just a lot easier now.",
      "Chargers go down so fast with flame throwers why are people bitching about them",
      "I'd take a bile nerf no problem...",
      "Grenade increasing armour has never felt so good. \n\nImpact Grenades people, use em",
      "I would like to be able to know roughly what kind of enemies I can expect from a mission.",
      "2 rounds to the ass pops them like a blister, I don't see the issue.",
      "I find bile spewers to be a fair challenge 99% of the time. You can dodge their puke attack if you dive left/right and time it right. Only time it becomes a bit clunky is if you're already kiting a bunch of bugs.",
      "They should have fixed lower difficulties too because 6 is still a mess of titans and chargers at least for me",
      "On the bright side at least I am not kiting 5000 chargers",
      "I bet they’ll keep changing around spawn rates so that our strategies have to change too!",
      "Autocannon mains are eating great now, gotta say :)",
      "What it feels like, had a whole conga line of spitters coming after me while I'm running and spraying behind me",
      "I hate those guys so much. Loads of health, instant killing attack, numerous, medium armor on the head. I just dont know how to kill them without using a support weapon. Maybe I should just always be strapped then. \n\nBut sometimes they arent even on missions?? I want to know the enemy types in the mission before going in.",
      "I don't think the Bile Titan reduction worked... had 6 on us  almost the second we activated the first silo in the new mission type.",
      "Message of the Day: impact Grenades oneshot any kind of spewer.",
      "Would LOVE some acid resistance armor",
      "3 zaps and their toast!",
      "these guys don’t like grenade launchers, g10 grenades are awesome when two of them are rushing you as well",
      "I'd rather deal with chargers. ",
      "I've made a couple comments before about how they're my least favorite enemy type. Unfun to play against every time I fight them.",
      "My autocannon is ready.",
      "Woe, 15 bile spewer patrol be upon ye",
      "\"Hey guys, I think you accidentally applied the defense mission spawn buff to all missions.\"\n\n\"Yeah, our bad. And also, go fuck yourself, here's triple the hunter swarms!\"",
      "These fucking little shits",
      "https://i.redd.it/mjgpnqzjm1oc1.gif",
      "And thus dawned the age of the arc cannon. My one true friend.  I fucking love that thing. \n\nDoesn't do much to titans and chargers but mows down everything else.",
      "Less Tanks (Titans/Chargers) and more lesser Enemies is a godsend for my Arc Thrower and Tesla Tower.\n\nThis means I can concentrate my big Stratagems to kill the Tanks when they appear.\n\nCan't wait for the new Shotgun, hope we have infinite ammo for it too, but I'm ok if not.",
      "these trigger me more than anything else 😂",
      "When I hopped in after the update and saw 10 stalkers start to chase me.\n\n![gif](giphy|51Uiuy5QBZNkoF3b2Z|downsized)",
      "I believe this is how it was before last update right?",
      "Holy crap, what is with the spawn rate today? I just did a medium solo run and there had to be around 30 to 40 swarming me at the pick up point. When I respawned, I was insta killed each time there was so many. Respawned outside the area and was still swamped in about 20 seconds. Normally I don't use but maybe on respawn, but this last mission was insane. Then with the server connection kick outs, I got nothing done today.",
      "I mean I'm okay with it more weapons work against them and so much better than trying to dodge for chargers at the same time and find the time to do anything about them while it's happening or like that one time where I somehow manage to survive suicide running through the legs of five bile Titans with a 500 kg bomb stratagem (fun moment but really shouldn't happen and if it happened a lot would be really problematic).",
      "These motherfuckers are my biggest enemy right now.\n\nAnd so are the stalkers\n\nAnd the hunters\n\nFuckers!",
      "So many fucking Chargers spawning last night one point I had four of them running at me. Fuck that shit.",
      "see this is how the bugs get from planet to planet...... spewwers acting like artillery",
      "I've never seen that big one in the middle in a mission. Are they even in the game yet?",
      "Please no.\n\nEverything but those 1 shotting ninjas..",
      "A new thing for the community to complain and whine about",
      "I feel like a see more bile titans on the new mission than ever before, legit spawned in and saw 4 immediately on impossible",
      "For real i feel like they just want to make stuff unfun and unreliable :\n\n- Give us a way to prevent reinforcement calls\n\n\\* Could be done with a bicolor calling with the first color lasting like 1sec\n\n- Stop spawn from thin air\n\nSpawners on the map feel irrelevent considering most mobs pop from reinforcement/thin air",
      "You people complain about everything",
      "Do those at least still die to safe mode railgun?",
      "The conga line of Hunters is also going to get worse....",
      "These cunts are still armoured and immune to 95% of primary weapons",
      "It takes 2-3 well placed slugger shots to down a spewer...\n\nWell placed is like a silver dollar sized spot on their face, but it's a thing you can pull off sometimes...\n\nThe MG tears em up good though, bless that things medium armor penn",
      "These things have plenty of armour",
      "I wish to be safe. jk jk. Didnt expect a Phas reference here.",
      "Flying stalkers incoming",
      "The grenade launcher makes 'em pop pretty nicely too!",
      "I thought their big ol booties would go pop if I shot them there - turns out their tick head is the weak spot. Real ammo saver.",
      "Like green huge pimples",
      "AMR works pretty nicely as well",
      "Dominator kills them in three shots, and the Arc thrower can usually two shot them.",
      "Sniper, found one on the map yesterday and oof did they disappear in the blink of an eye",
      "Is there a way to know when they're going to be in the spawn pool before selecting weapons, though?\n\nSometimes I wanna run different stuff but I definitely want grenade launcher and autocannon when these are on mission",
      "Single shot to the head with an AMR also does the job.",
      "I never stopped. I've always ran with it and the Lazer Dog. Still trying to make up my mind with my primary.",
      "where do you aim on them?  I always feel like I use the entire clip just to kill like 4 of them, but I also don't use it much so not that great at aiming yet",
      "Railgun also 1 taps their heads",
      "Top tier meme comment right here! ^^^",
      "I feel like every tanky enemy that should be slow is just as fast as you. As annoying as it can be, I like the chaos and panic it induces as you beg your teammates for help while trying to shoot and call down stratagems!",
      "Because democracy could only provide you with the righteous amount of legs, two, while the vile bugs have an absolutely communist number of legs to propel them quickly after you.",
      "Every animal on more than 2 legs is faster than humans! From the rabbit to the elephant, giraffe, rhino, whatever. We're really really slow 😅",
      "Fat fuck about to instakill you out of nothing.",
      "A swarm of Spewers and Pukers (Nursing Spewers) is a different kind of hell. Frantically diving 8 streams of acid only to be absolutely melted by an unseen volley from behind is... frustrating.",
      "Bile spewer are arguably worse than bile titans.",
      "Friendly reminder that bile spew is considered explosive damage, do with that information what you will",
      "They are easier to dogde and i think they are fun to deal with, i almost play with them if there are just like two of them but these green fuckers slow you down even if you dogde the damage.",
      "But incendiary grenade go *fwoosh*",
      "Sweet, you have 4.  On higher difficulties you can see a dozen of these fuckers at a time.",
      "Only if we swap backpacks and be the ultimate crew-served weapon team!",
      "I feel like it might be a slight issue with the dive hotbox maybe? Sometimes I dive and it misses or just injures me, but other times it hits my toe hair for an insta kill. It might be a slight sync issue as well.",
      "While I'm sure there will be more Bile Spewers, I have a feeling what will really happen is there will be more little guys and Hunters...lots more.",
      "I was thinking earlier that I’d probably be fine just with the change to Charger’s head health and them not touching the spawns. My only issue with chargers is them being so annoying to kill pre-patch, bile spitters and hunters are fucking annoying so I don’t want more.",
      "That's the fun",
      "Is 5 minutes too long to laugh at this?",
      "4-6? Bro I had 15 on me before the update. 4-6 is fine.",
      "Licky-licky conga line, that's why.",
      "Saw a never ending line of the damn things on the termicide mission when we went to extract. Suddenly they all put their butts in the air and our hill went green. Nobody survived that one barrage haha. There were probably 40 of the damn things",
      "Grenade launcher deals with them rather well, tbh. \n\nEngineer Armor + impact grenades is also a good combo",
      "Quickly dumping a Redeemer magazine in its head is fairly reliable. Otherwise you need a grenade launcher, or to suck it up and bring an Engineering Kit armor for more grenades. Probably should get used to using Resupply more often, if possible.",
      "Slugger can kill them in 2-3 headshots in my experience.",
      "2 headshots with the arc thrower kills them. Only problem is their body now attracts your electricity and the bugs behind get cover.\n\nGrenade launcher is amazing against them",
      "Bro, I love that strategem!",
      "You can consistently kill chargers in 6 shots with the auto cannon now. Just let it charge past you and aim at its butt and unload 6 times at it. I consistently kill every chargers with the autocannon this way.\n\nYou may need an armor with the 30% more accuracy while crouching or prone though. This perk makes autocannon recoil nonexistent if you crouch or prone.",
      "I thought maybe I was unlucky, did a 7 earlier and had 5 chargers and 2 titans up. Sure they're easier to kill but add in the constant bile throwers and it got a bit dicey. \n\nWe also dropped at the extraction point for an egg hunt....the extraction was inside a giant hive, the egg nest seemed to be attached to a large and medium hive with the extraction in the middle. Absolute shit show, fun but Jesus did we lose a lost of helldivers in the opening 10minutes.",
      "Slugger 2 taps spitters in the head, and most non heavy bugs in 3 or less shots to the dome",
      "Yeah thats because its actualy the head that is the weakspot.",
      "It seems to be an ability only the armored variants have. Not sure if they ghost launched them or not.",
      "They only do it on difficulty 7 and up",
      "Explosives to the big sack are quite effective.",
      "Well, we have flying ones now so there's definitely more variants.",
      "Add on engineer Armor and impact grenades!",
      "That's just wrong. They spawn *way* more bile spewers now and they seem to be more aggro too. Even with nades its hard to get rid off them because they close the distance so quick and you end up nading yourself half the time.",
      "Which isn’t a bad thing. If you want a harder game just use bad weapons.",
      "The problem was never that There was too many chargers. The problem is there was too many Heavies at once. These bastards Are Worse then chargers in large groups. They are Basically smaller medium armor bile titans. Easier to kill but spawn as often as Other medium Tier units. Which causes a problem when every bug breach and patrol has at least 2 of them and they don't need to see you to start attacking",
      "Slugger kills them in 4 headshots. Explosives to their Sacks stagger and also deal heavy damage. It's a Any gun to the sack also deals a lot of damage since the sides are Unarmored. The problem is they are Fast as Fuck Just Slightly slower then a light armor sprint. Have the same one shot spit attack as hive spewers and titans and spawn in groups of 400. Every breach spawns 2-3 and every patrol has at least 2.\n\nThe literally just Swapped out hordes of chargers for hordes of Mini Itians with one shot range attacks lol. Weaker sure but harder to handle in large groups. Chargers you just have to simply matador them but spewers require Full attention Like a titan",
      "Yeah, it's an armored variant that appears on the higher difficulties (sometimes in the upper mid but much more rare). They shoot taco bell poo mortars at you...it's horrible. The one encounter I had where they actually used the mortar ability I was dodging attacks from 3 or 4 Spewers. I dodged all of them and got mortared right in the face. It didn't kill me, but it slowed me enough so the Spewers right on me could send another volley.",
      "Don't worry. I'm sure there will also be slews of Hunters and Stalkers, too!",
      "I certainly hope not. As much as Bile Spewers can be annoying, I really just wanted to make a funny meme.",
      "I’ve also heard that Stalker nests spawn more Stalkers now.",
      "Breaker spray and pray is very good now.",
      "I run Duo 7s with a buddy and he was adamant about always using the Stalwart. I used to give him a hard time about it, saying he needs more anti-armor utility at the higher diffs. \n\nWell, it's absolutely paying off for him now! \n\nHe runs Stalwart and shield to just chew through all the trash mobs, with a Slugger to punch through Hive Guards. \n\nI've started running Recoilless, because DAMN if it isn't satisfying blasting a Charger's head off. \n\nCombo works really well, honestly.",
      "I will take chargers any day, especially with the new eat and rr buffs",
      "That is the single best image I’ve had pop into my head in a while lol someone please animate hunters doing a conga line as a lonesome cadet continuously trips over himself trying to get away.",
      "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Monkey%27s\\_Paw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkey%27s_Paw)",
      "If there's a bunch of em clustered up a humble eagle airstrike works like a charm too",
      "Also impact nades to the head.",
      "also you can send them to low orbit with the impact nade",
      "The slugger makes them cum real nicely",
      "For explosive weapons like the autocannon and grenade launcher, the sac is much more vulnerable. For everything else, aim for the head.",
      "I'm pretty sure if you explode the butt they explode and deal damage, so while it takes more shots it can take a few little guys with it. Or maybe it's just us that take damage when they explode lul",
      "I randomly came across a Facebook short about the bile spewers yesterday and it has saved me so much ammo aiming for the head.",
      "The problem I have encountered with the arc thrower is that their corpses block the targeting of it. So I'll kill 2-3, they block my line of fire but the others behind can simply walk through the bodies and spit at me. They really gotta take another look at corpse collision between enemies",
      "Which sniper?",
      "I stopped running it because I started running EAT for bigger targets and I only have so many stratagem slots. Don't get me wrong I still love the Nade Launcher, but it's hard to balance what's necessary to bring when you only have so many slots. Especially when I refuse to play without my supply pack lol",
      "Let me know if you figure out the primary situation. People were hyping up the Slugger and I don’t like it",
      "Slow firing weapons with the laser dog. Like the slugger. \n\nOr just always bring the slugger",
      "I ran it but also ran the supply pack to really spam out the shots. For sure a bit overkill but dang I could clear out nests and swarms quickly.\n\nI did drop it then I could not contribute against charges effectively... My one buddy rune RR when he is on so that may be my time",
      "Ive been enjoying the slugger! 1 shot to the head on hunters is real nice.",
      "I like the Spray and Pray now. Nade launcher clears our bigger threats, S&P clears out small ones",
      "I've been seriously considering the slugger.",
      "Wouldn’t ammo be a big concern?",
      "I would usually find ammo on the ground or someone would call for a resupply. So running out really never came up except once or twice.",
      "I usually aim under their head and bounce the nade off the ground into their abdomen if i have time to aim. Otherwise, I mag dump and run",
      "Wish those bastards made louder noises when moving though. The ammount of times I get sneak on by a blitzing charger is way too high.",
      "But we have high stamina!",
      "2 fwumps for the pukers and 3 fwumps for the spewers from the nade launcher causes all near by ones to chain. The auto cannon is also pretty sweet for the fatties.",
      "Honestly this is why I bring impact grenades most of the time. They aren’t the best for bug holes but an army of spewers all just pops like berries. ",
      "The orange ones aren’t bad. The breaker can easily deal with them. The green ones with their armoured head? Nah that’s a “imma head out” from me. Fuck those guys",
      "At least the nursing spewer can be popped with 2 slugger headshot, the medium armored one takes like 4.",
      "Honestly, bile titans aren't *that* dangerous. They're somewhat slow, they're easy to hit, and they only really have two attacks, the bile spit and stepping on you. They're just really tanky, and basically act as an area denial enemy, forcing you into particular spots while you try to fight other bugs.",
      "You fr right now?",
      "if that's true that's dumb as hell. if anything it should be more akin to fire damage, since it's a stream of damage, and I assume the bile is meant to be acidic or something. no wonder they kill you instantly if it's the equivalent of like 10 impact grenades in a 2 second span.",
      "Impacts one shot bile spewers and most little bugs around them. Bring an engineer suit and a supply pack and watch as they all just disappear.",
      "Take engineering armor and a supply pack. Now you have 6, plus you can resupply yourself for even more.",
      "I’m down for that!",
      "I'm thinking that also, cause it's the same with me. Now I always bring my shield pack with me to bug missions since I blocks out the small amount that used to hit me",
      "....yeah I guess thats one way of putting it lmao",
      "Huzzah! I mean damn, more alien scum (ik not a traitor I swear).",
      "I’ve only seen bile spewers once so far and it was only on a night map in Meridia.",

      "Oooooohhhhh, that explains why one nest gave me so much trouble today.",
      "Other day I turned around and saw like five stalkers running at me",
      "Stalkers spawn 4 instead of 2 and spawn on level 4 and up  missions now.",
      "They already spawned more as of the previous patch. I havent seen a lair with less than 6 stalkers since it dropped.",
      "So far ive seen 6 on a single d9 nest! And I feel they spawn in faster now",
      "In my experience yes, it seemed they used to only spawn 2 active per nest, I just ran a mission where there were 4 active with 1 nest",
      "Yeah, 1 nest seems to allow 4 instead of two at a time. Idk about spawn rates.",
      "I see 4 Instead of 2.   Much rather deal with chargers.   Also orbital laser and punisher feel nerfed",
      "You need a MG or Stalwart to deal with the little guys or else your AT guy just gets swarmed along with you. You can use a grenade launcher, but if your buddy is getting swarmed you risk hitting your fellow Helldiver and fucking their aim. A trash mob guy and a heavy guy are essential in the Helldiver buddy team if you ask me.",
      "People who use shield should really just try the laser rover. I can't help but think the people who use it just never tried anything else and don't realize how easy it is to avoid damage on bug missions in general, let alone when something is killing adds for you constantly.",

      "if they lose their ass they lose the ability to charge and bleed out after a few seconds and can ignore them",
      "The support weapon, one shot to the face",
      "I'll be honest, I gave up carrying sentries to Cary Orbital Rail Cannon, Eagle Rocket Pods, Grenade launcher, and The Lazer Dog. It works for me, but I don't know if I would recommend it.",
      "You can run Grenade Launcher, Supply Pack and EAT with Eagles or low CD Orbital like EMS strike. It's that simple.",
      "I'd like the EAT if I didn't have to call it in all the time. It's just one more thing to worry about when handling a swarm.",

      "Honestly, after 120 hours of using running almost exclusively impact nades closing bug holes with normal ones feels wrong. I really got used to impact aim/timings",
      "At least once every ten impact grenades some hunter will go \"get down mr president\" and jump into my grenade arm so i've stopped running them",
      "You just gotta know when to throw, and where to aim. It isnt so hard after a while. I main impact nades.",
      "The biggest part for me is, \"Oops, I brushed its leg as I ran by. I guess I'll die now.\"",
      "One impact nade to the midsection of their underbelly destroys their bile sacs, making them essentially harmless as long as you have stamina.",
      "Assuming the other posts and people talking about it are correct then yes, plus after using the explosive armor myself a bit it def *feels* like I’m surviving those spews a bit more often or with more HP",
      "Just the name of the damage classification, not really the same as getting impact naded or anything like that especially as you can dodge bile far easier than dodge an impact explosion. It’s like how the Dominator, Scorcher and the Concussive Rifle are all technically “explosive” in status even if the original wording is confusing as their functionalities are still very different from one another. \n\nI’m sure maybe later on they could expand the status’s and whatnot to make it clearer or relabel the armors to say explosive *and* stinky burny puke bile but for now you now know what armor to wear to protect yourself against specific elites of each faction.",
      "Hear me out.\n\nEngineer Suit + incendiaries/ impacts + grenade launcher+ supply pack = 1 Democratic Helldiver",
      "i dont think the supply packs replenish grenades, they do give launcher belts though",

      "You've seen them *once*? They're everywhere above difficulty 7.",
      "It’s the only logical solution. The casuals are the reason this game is so successful right now, not the die hard HD fans. The all time peak of HD1 was 6,744 players, for the second game it’s almost 460k - casuals are the moneymaker so the game needs to be more accessible for those people, if you like or not, you can gatekeep as much as you want, it won’t matter.",
      "That's the face I make when I'm surrounded by a whole conga line of Hunters slowing me down and I see the inevitable poo mortars.",

      "Nope. Had to fight 3 yesterday",
      "I dropped into a match with 3 stalker nests. Didn’t help that we landed in a contested area with two Bile Titans immediately emerging along with a handful of chargers. The match didn’t last long. It was baaaad.",

      "Hey, it´s not like they are super fast so I like to toast them with 500 kg. Just wish it had a larger AOE though. \n\nThe graphical effect and sound for 500 kg are top notch, but you quickly realize that it has small reach, sadly.",

      "2 to the face, 3 to the ass in my experience. But the ass can do splash damage to other bugs so it can be worth the extra round.",
      "My go to has been EAT, Supply Pack, Eagle Cluster, and Orbital Railcanon. But I feel like I'm not utilizing my stattagems enough, and I wanna bring Nade Launcher now with the rise of Bile Spewers. It'll also be great for dealing with bug holes. The problem is what do I drop? I love EAT and always bring Supply Pack because I hate running out of resources, and Cluster is pretty much the best fodder killer AOE. That just leaves dropping Rail Cannon for Nade Launcher— but then I'm running three support stratagems and that just feels like too much. So the only other thing to do is drop the Supply Pack which I really don't want to, but it feels like the only option.",
      "I use the same except replace rocket pods with orbital burst for trash mobs (groups of hunters).",
      "I like the laser dog when i solo lower difficulties.. but in teams i hate them.. They are at least as damaging to me and my team as the enemies are. The slightest elevation and it'll shoot you in the head. Sometimes the damage it does to me is insane too. guess it's headshot damage or something.",
      "call them before an encounter, and during the encounter anytime you have a short breather and the cooldown is finished. low cooldown means after a while you'll just have a bunch of them laying around for your team to pick up. trying to call them when you're being chased by a group is way worse than just circling around and picking up the ones that are just laying around",
      "Not too sure how big the aoe is when they blow, but *all* bugs in the blast get deleted. Fatties are a great place to start thinning the hoard with your nade launcher or auto cannon.",
      "It's why I run impact nades against bugs. One impact nade on them and it's lights out for the spewers ",
      "Found them inconsistent on bot factories though",
      "Had that happen with the EAT today. Blew my ass across the map and died. ",
      "I guess that makes explosive resistant armor the best against robots *and* bugs, then.",
      "Very similar to my favorite. Only I normal run a light armor with medium rating for more mobility. Nade launcher and ammo pack is crazy, especially for the armored spitters. Haven’t unlocked incendiary yet but that sounds amazing.",
      "Pretty sure they act just like the ones you get from supply drops, giving stims, ammo and grenades. Could be wrong though.",
      "Again,  I’ve only seen them on Meridia at night post patch.",
      "There are difficulty options for \"casuals\".\n\nCasuals who never have enough time for video games asked for difficulty sliders in difficult games that didn't have them. On the other hand, this game has an actual difficulty slider, yet you suggest that making the hardest difficulty levels easier for casuals is logical?",
      "No.  The game will fail if you bet everything on your temporary player base.  Casuals are not the money maker.  \n\nI’m gatekeeping?  LOL what exactly am I gatekeeping?",
      "Well, at least they stop spawning once you plug the bughole.",
      "They're going grape him.",
      "Yeah, but if the spawns were increased, you would have seen a lot more than normal?  Before patch we could have 3-9 stalkers in a matter of seconds.\n\nSo if the spawns were increased, we would see even more now?\n\nI'm just saying it felt less than usual yesterday. 3 is nothing, a walk in the park. People here on reddit made it sound like they were attacked by hunter numbers of stalkers wich i didn't  experience at all",
      "yeah a lot of explosions could use a shrapnel/shock cone that messes up light targets outside the immediate blast radius",
      "Yeah for real tho lol i dropped one on a bunch of just normal automatons and it was a close hit killed like 2 and 3 walked out of the fireball with just A bit of dust on them",
      "Personally I would drop the supply pack, the objectives always seem to have enough ammo packs lying around to supplement until the next resupply package can deliver",
      "That's a great strat! I've seen them get armor on the higher difficulties, but I've been farming samples and such on the mid tier difficulties so I've just been headshotting with my primary for the most part.",
      "Hell, you can probably just toss an impact nade and get similar results. The key is explosive damage. Wonder how the Scorcher does...",
      "Throwing them into the door when it opens tends to work better.",
      "Now if only it was the best against our own explosives… even the heavy sets it’s so easy to one shot yourself, you’re almost better off just running the 50-50 armor instead. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve stupidly shot a bug too close to me or had one Mr President Get Down’d my ass with the new plasma shotty",
      "Me with the grenade boost from the engineer set: \n\nI AM THE EAGLE NAPALM STRIKE!",
      "No there are not difficulty options for casuals. Or are you trying to say casuals need to be locked out of content of the game? \n\nIt’s not a real difficulty slider - samples, and content with them, are locked behind  higher difficulties, so simply lowering difficulty isn’t really an option if you want to enjoy all content. Not to mention that tons of negative modifiers barely qualify as higher difficulty, it’s an annoyance, not difficult.",
      "That’s why cod fails year after year, right? Oh wait - it breaks sales records almost every year.",
      "This is true\n\n\nGET TO PLUGGIN BOYS!",
      "Until they can spawn out of bug breaches.  \n\n\nReally hoping the devs don't see this comment.",
      "If only teammates understood this importance",
      "Not really a walk in the park, when your pal decided to play a two man army on a blitz objective. I've flyed more than walked",
      "Do ammo packs replenish support weapons, though? I thought only supply packs did that.",
      "Yeah, the spewers (with artillery) have armour on the front that can cause a shot to ricochet. You want to aim right for the green sac of goo. It’s best to get them from the side or from above (the jump pack is great for this)",
      "not that well tbh. 6 or 7 shots to kill one spewer, it's not a good weapon for bugs (amazing vs bots though)\n\nmost spewers I popped in one was 8 with a grenade launcher.. it was fantastic to see!",
      "Oh right, thanks",
      "The upgrades aren't really much \"content\" in my opinion. You can do without them in lower difficulty levels. I have some level 3's unlocked and I could say that they aren't really a big deal, but I could get feeling left out when you don't have them. Also, why would a \"casual\" even bother themselves with grinding? Isn't the fun of the game shooting and blowing up bugs?\n\nSpawn count increases, and spawn types, and enemy abilities are only in some higher difficulty levels. Bile Spewers for example don't have an artillery mode in lower difficulties.\n\nNegative mods remind me really of Path of Exile's map mods. Some are ineffectual, some are debilitating, usually depending on your build. I could for example completely prevent accidents from scrambled strategems if I just use an all-support weapon or a sentry loadout. Negative mods can make the game a bit more interesting, but I think the current negative mods aren't quite there yet. Like for you, they're only a mere annoyance for now. Maybe in the future, they'll add more (interesting) effects like, minefields, all spawns are Bile Titans, more frequent meteor showers, etc.\n\nThere are people who do enjoy and can only enjoy lower difficulty levels in Helldivers 2 out there. Not everyone only farmed level 9 automaton eradication missions a week or two ago.",
      "The TTK in CoD is not casual lol.  I don’t remember nerfs to Veteran either.",
      "BUG PLUGS! GET YOUR BUG PLUGS HERE!",
      "Why...why would you speak this into existence?",
      "Yes they do, the difference is ammo packs only refill your primary, secondary, and support weapons. Supply packs also give you grenades and stims",
      "Fast TTK **IS** casual. Thats why cod is successful - even the worst player gets kills this way. That’s why casuals keep buying the games year after year.",
      "Ayo 🤨",
      "In a word?  \n......  \n\n\n**Chaos.**",
      "Fast TTK is not casual.",
      "*Hands you a pack of grenades*  \n\n\nWhat did you think we meant?",
      "Then you have no idea what you are talking about. It’s really obvious that a fast TTK is casual and always was. With a long TTK you need to able to track your target to get a kill - something casuals won’t be able to do. \n\nIf a bad player faces a good player in a long TTK game their chance of winning against the good player is zero - they won’t be able to track the good player while the good player can. If a bad player faces a good player in a fast TTK game it doesn’t matter if they can’t track - it’s not needed, if they see them first they win the fight due to the fast TTK."

      "Give me a fancy star and reset the level",
      "A prestige system like DRG could be cool. Or giving players the retroactive xp they accumulated up to the point of the level cap increase, like DICE did with BF5.",
      "What's the point of the level cap anyway? you are not unlocking anything as you level up except for those rank icon and title",
      "Instead of just a level cap increase I'd like to see alternative titles you can grind out. Something like extract with samples 100, 500, 1000. Gets you titles like \"Away team\". Or something more comical in the helldiver universe.",
      "Raise it to 100 and make the work from 50 to 100 a reeeeally slow crawl like HD1's 25 to 50.",
      "They could easily just lift the levels to 500 and make up names for them.\n\nHonestly, I don't even care about levels. I am here just to shoot some bugs.",
      "I wouldn't mind a classic prestige system a la CoD4",
      "Prestige, or a way to 'buy' a demotion would be nice.\n\nIdeally, more granularity in the ranking and a different progression system altogether could have done a better job than the linear progression we got. At least you can use any titles.\n\nI'm thinking back to Halo 3, which had side-grade titles that depended on what your max level in ranked multiplayer was. I do remember staying a Brigadier General by choice, because at the end everyone was rank 50 and goldygoldy.",
      "Make an extra medals cosmetic. Once you reach level 50 you should be able to reset to lvl 1 (but keeping all strategems). When you do you'll get a medal cosmetic you can add to your armour (max 3 to 5 slots?). Bronze skull, silver skull, gold skull, Medal or tyranid slaying, automaton Skull etc. Would be pretty cool",
      "Be able to convert requisition into medals. ",
      "I'd like leveling like Overwatch frankly. After 50 you just get a bit on your icon and reset to 1.",
      "Before raising the lvl cap, how about they fill the last 30 levels with content? It's a bit empty past lvl 20. ",
      "OH GOD I NEED THIS. And more silly (occasionally not silly) titles. \n  \nThis is by far one of the simplest and somewhat meaningful progression for some people (myself included) \n  \nI just love those numbers.",
      "It'd be cool if when at level cap, you fill a bar of fixed amount with the extra XP and get a fixed amount of medals when it's full.\n\nEmpty the bar, rinse and repeat",
      "I don't want a level \"reset\" or prestige where you gotta rebuy your stratagems. Increase the level cap so we can watch number go up and get the happy chemicals. Don't even care about rewards, just have them be cosmetic",
      "So what about all the XP I'm earning at lvl 50? Will that be retroactively applied when they increase the cap.",
      "I'm down for this, just give me cool titles along the way. So I can work towards SOMETHING.",
      "The most \"I can't tell you directly cause I will get hanged upside down by balls but I will try to\" dev answer I've ever seen. Love AH devs, they feel like people.",
      "They don't have stratagems up to 50 yet. I would think they would do that before a level cap increase since the current levels are not even fully utilized.",
      "By my estimates I would be around level 70 possibly 80 at this point. I've almost completely maxed the game in every aspect and I can't wait to see my xp increase again",

      "Prestige system would sort this out after a bit of an extended lvl cap.",
      "A prestige system like Hunt Showdown would be great. Every time you get to level 50, prestiging grants a different unique cosmetic and a badge. But resets strategems and ship modules. \n\nThis way Req and samples have a purpose again.",
      "Ideas: \n- Once capped at level 50 have an option to prestige and earn a star next to your title “Death Captain ⭐️x5.” Or a cape with your prestige stars: regardless you’d reset to level 1 with a star or icon somewhere \n\n- Allow customization options to the destroyer for requisition slips. An operators chair, cosmetic options?\n\n- Customization for guns: charms, sights, colors (nothing crazy) \n\n- Firing range to test new weapons \n\n- A cabinet with collectibles or feats achieved in your career for others to check out.\n\nI’m sure these have all been discussed internally. This would keep people playing honestly. Because once I hit level 50 and max out everything I won’t have much desire fellas",

      "What do levels do other than unlock strats. Not really much point in raising level other than patting yourself on the back",
      "I just want to make sure that there's some way to tell how much xp someone's gotten after the point of hitting level 50, tbh. Raise the level cap, add prestige of any kind, exactly what you do doesn't matter to me. I just wanna know if someone is level 50 or level 50, 20 times over. Big difference in what kind of player that is!",
      "I second what others have said, instead of having a total max level cap, give us an option to prestige!",
      "Hope it comes with a material cap increase too.",
      "Maybe a prestige system which grants you like a few 100 supercredits or a random armor piece would be a cool thing to do. Looking forward to the coming updates!",
      "Good, goood!",
      "I just hope they think of even more awesome rank titles.",
      "I mean it would have to.\n\nIf they just keep releasing new Strats for sub-50, all the Level 50 players will be able to instantly buy them with all their accrued Requisitions and still have nothing further to work toward (save maybe whatever they have left on any Warbonds).\n\nOr they'd have to start tying some new unlocks to in-game feats, like \"Kill 100 Chargers with the Recoilless Rifle to unlock [NEW THING]\"",
      "I love when there is no hard lvl cap. Like after lvl x to get to lvl x+1 you need double the xp as to get to lvl x. So technically you can go on forever, but realistically only a few more levels.",

      "It feels really bad to be XP capped (not being able to get more XP anymore). Easiest solution would be either to have prestige by \"reseting levels\".\n\nAnother one could be what OW have/had that you have visible \"cosmetic\" levels. So you can show off that you have more XP than anybody else in your account.\n\nParagon levels could also be a thing. But what it could give you? Either something really small upgrades but I think its not how Arrowhead want to do things.\n\nSo maybe you could use paragon level \"points\" to upgrade your ship by cosmetics?\n\nAnyways. Something like this.",
      "Guys, going off their cryptic message, I'm gonna say they're probably gonna raise the lvl cap. Might be wrong tho",
      "I mean, this was a very non-committal answer, but logically it would make sense to raise the cap. I've been 50 since three weeks after launch! I'm a no-lifer, sure, but at least I came by it honestly and not by farming eradications lol",
      "I'd like the title \"President of Hell\" please",
      "Why the tease, just do it",
      "The lvl cap must go up to at least 100. The amount of lvl 50's after only a 1.5 months is huge. ",
      "Why not just make the level number go on forever and worry about rewards later, if at all. People just want to see number get bigger anyways.",
      "Nay to resetting levels, this is COD mentality.  Once you reach max level, give us a secondary XP bar that includes new titles, capes, medals on armor showing ranks, modified weapons, etc.",
      "Prestige and let me upgrade all my ship parts one more time. I want to be able to prestige 7 times and have 8 500kg bombs on tap. 9 minute 380 Barrages. Sentries with 100000 rounds of ammunition and more health than a Bile Titan's leg.",
      "Prestige is, by far, the easiest solution to this. Offer a spiffy cape and banner for each prestige level and voila.",

      "Reach level 25, prestige, keep everything you unlocked...yay...repeat.",
      "There's 2 types of levels in DRG;\n\nFirst is for your class, represented with red color, which you can increase it to 25. When you hit 25, you promote the class and go back to 1 but gain a star... then 2 stars, 3 stars, then silver star, 2 silver stars, 3 silver stars and gold star etc. More stars you gain, your class portrait will be more decorated as well.\n\nSecond is for your account and the color is blue, since you have 4 classes, leveling up any class 3 times grants you 1 account level.\n\nI do believe that DRG's system is good for DRG but not good for HD2. What they need to add is an indicator of \"true\" level.\n\nEvery time you accumulate enough xp to level up from 49 to 50, you gain 1 extra prestige level. It can be represented as 50(+X), X is the number of your prestige level.\n\nThis is how it works in Tides games if you mod your game to show true level, and I think it's simple and effective.",
      "Won't be 10 words.\n\nBut essentially, every 25 levels earned on a class (there are 4) allows a promotion and a new prestige star. This is theoretically infinite, but you can only see the progression beyond a certain point with a mod (It is funny seeing someone drop in with 3 legendary stars and a +37 next to their icon though.)\n\nThat said, DRG itself does a simply brilliant job of ensuring that those prestige stars simply....don't matter much.\n\nYou have everything unlocked for your class by the time you hit your first promotion (prestige star.) They really are more of a badge of time played than of anything else. You can roughly correlate different colors of prestige stars with time played and thus with skill levels, but I've seen 3rd promotion players outplay 12th promotion players. There are a lot of hours between those promotions. In short, the prestige stars don't mean much, and that's beautiful.\n\nBut that's the beauty of DRG. There is not real 'outplaying'. There is only mining morkite and gold, and killing bugs and bots, and playing as a team.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou'll notice a number of posts in this HD sub lamenting people's lack of using voice chat and thus being unable to coordinate a team Super Earth effectively?\n\nDRG's sub has the occasional post going, \"I'm anxious about being a noob and don't have/want to use a mic. Would this game be good for me?\"\n\nThe response is invariably, \"I've heard 1 person use voice chat in 500hrs of gameplay. Don't worry about being a noob. No one cares. The entire community will help you\"\n\nThe way DRG fosters teamwork is completely nonverbal and incredibly effective, but it's baked into the core design of the game. DRG requires teamwork, and makes you feel good for playing your class as a and in part of a team.\n\nHD2 allows for teamwork. It doesn't quite nail it as well as DRG does. I still have high hopes for where HD2 can go.\n\nDRG is just a brillinat game that literally forces people to play nice with each other. It is also completely non predatory about unlocks/battlepasses etc.\n\nJoin us in the mines! Rock and Stone.",
      "Idk why the downvotes, sounds pretty sound to me. It would be pretty underwhelming *for long time players* to just insta-unlock everything with all the XP that hadn't been taken into account, but at the same time this doesn't aknowledge the time and effort players would've poured into the game by just Thanos snapping the XP.",
      "Aside from unlocking titles, what is the xp level progression for? Traditionally, exp levels improve character stats, but since all Helldivers are the same, it feels like a bit artificial way to have buyable things behind.",

      "Part of it is that it's just easier to carry clueless teammates in DRG because of the way dying works.\n\n\nIf you die in DRG, you're just \"downed\", where your body acts as a lure for enemies. You're not dealing damage, but you also aren't making things worse.\n\n\nIf you die in Helldivers, each death takes away from the team's total. Deaths mean lost samples and weapons. Reinforces also allegedly increase patrol spawn rates, which makes things even harder to carry.\n\n\nNot to mention that friendly fire is way lower in DRG (even on max difficulty, it's 70%, 35% with the Friendly perk) so it's harder to get teamkilled by a clueless teammate. Driller's C4 blows up teammates in a 5m radius. A Eagle Cluster Bomb blows up teammates in a 30-35m radius.",
      "It's to reduce choices for new players so they aren't stuck with choice paralysis when they open the strategem screen.

And it’s pretty valid, there were quite a few stealth changes such as armor penetration angles on the EAT and recoilless. \nHowever the whole “steering lock” fiasco that you’re currently witnessing was on that stealth change list too, and has not been confirmed by the devs. \n\nNeedless to say this whole thing could have been avoided if the devs were more thorough and kept the players up to date.

      "Stealth patch notes suck, yes. But stealth additions like events and enemies are awesome. Love the surprises.",
      "I find it odd that people say that lock was a stealth change when i remember it happening even before the patch.",
      "Agreed, the patch notes are very hit and miss here.\n\nSome things should definitely stay hidden, though. Like the new enemies.",
      "There's about 50 different primary weapon attributes that are completely opaque to us. Not shown anywhere or viewable. Source- the Devs.",
      "Personally, the only things that should ever be hidden are new Enemies, Stratagem, armour and weapons. \n\nMoved the ammo counter over by 5 pixels? I want to know.",
      "I’ve noticed intermittent steering lock since day 1.",
      "steering lock has been in the game since launch though. you can be spawn on flat ground but you get locking into only veering left or right without you pressing anything",
      "I think the biggest issue with stealth patches is that it becomes harder and harder to deem something as being an intentional change or an unintended bug. And at one point I figured this *could* be the case.\n\nUntil a dev literally confirmed a few of those stealth patches to be real. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen what the fuck?! lol. Like I'm ok with stealth changes that improve something. Something like the Punisher ammo buff and how it applied to the Slugger. Discovering something like that isn't as bad. \n\nBut finding out nerfs or discovering that something that used to work no longer does that were not noted in patch notes absolutely sucks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to be fully on Arrowheads side and give them the benefit of the doubt but it gets harder and harder when things like this happen. I can't really defend them saying something could just potentially be a bug if they make stealth changes so frequently, especially when they acknowledge they've done it.",
      "stealth changes arent always intentional, sometimes they are just unintended bugs they have a hard time tracking down.",
      "I never understood the concept of “stealth changes” in the 1st place. I mean, your community is going to find out one way or another, sooner than later, so why keep it secret?",
      "Some of the blame also needs to go to the guy who made the post that currently has 7k upvotes, who takes a cropped screenshot of the “stealth patch notes”, and makes it look like this change was released in the patch notes by the devs. Everyone saw it and immediately thought there was no way this could possibly be a bug. Whoever made that thread was intentionally trying to be misleading.",
      "Is the steering lock a confirmed bug? Where have you seen that this wasn’t an intended change?",
      "I would like them to be clear as well but people are going to spread misinformation anyway.  People will read a statement and go and tell everyone the devs confirmed something stupid.\n\n\nPeople are always going to try and misinform, manipulate and misrepresent to manufacture their narrative.  You can better inform those that will shoot that shit down though.",
      "I will say, that while the steering lock is definitely bad now and got worse after the update, I experienced it before the update (just a bit less).\n\nAlso it seems to not really have anything to do with terrain in my experience, sometimes I can land on a high up \"safe\" zone no problem and other times I can't steer anywhere and the terrain is open as fuck",
      "The hellpod descent control has gotten worse. I've had instances where I'm dropping, and I'm tilting my stick right, but the hellpod refuses to drop in that direction, insisting on dropping as if I wasn't trying to steer it at all.",
      "not just stealth patch notes, the mystique they cover mechanics in, in of itself creates weird situations.   \n\n\nlike we're not even sure after that last patch if legging chargers was intended meta (afaik, it looks like they intended us to blow up charger heads)",
      "Studio grew too quickly and is trying to juggle too many moving parts. The consequence is low supervision and low quality control.\n\nIn an ideal world everything gets extensive QA and stress testing and documentation before being sent live. Eg patrols spawning around players is a bug, this shouldn’t have made it to live.",
      "what fake info?",
      "The game can be confusing at times. Diff 7 sometimes feels like diff 9 and sometimes like diff 5... and that's with the same team. Problem is, you can't trust ANY source of Informations... including the devs. What they say and what stealth changes do, sometimes doesn't fit either. It's a great game, but the frustration level is very high.\n\nAnother thing is, you need a certain skill level to feel what devs want, but a higher skill level to feel what YOU want. So people with higher skill have the fun you want to have, but your skill only allow you to experience the bullshit devs think is fun.",
      "Its my biggest pet peeve when patch notes don't actually say what was changed. Souls games are the biggest offenders",
      "It could be an emergent bug. Not everything is intentional. Especially for as quickly as patch iterations are being released. ",
      "Who said steering lock was false info? Anyone who has used a hellpod pre patch can tell that theres a difference.",
      "idk personally i’ve been playing since launch and YES steering lock has always existed but it’s much worse than what it used to be. on top of this i’m often steered straight into patrols or groups of enemies which is straight up so annoying because then the person who called me in is just gonna run away while im SOL with no gear rawdogging like 4 chargers, a swarm of hunters, and maybe 2 biles. i was specifically trying to avoid THAT!\n\nwhether it’s an intentional stealth change or bug doesn’t matter to me but i’m sure the devs have that info",
      "This isn’t some new thing I’ve had power steering for quite some time.",
      "Steering lock has been a thing from Day 1. My girlfriend gets it a lot on PC, and we don't know why. I only get it when I'm close to something out of bounds.",
      "Not disagreeing, but I do find it funny how the shadow patches kind of meet the criteria of like faulty equipment that is grunts never get informed of lmao. Shit writes itself really",
      "Honestly I would love if the Devs were a bit more through with information in general.\nLike supposedly each weapon has something like 50 stats, But we only see 5 of those. So of which, 2 of two those stats aren't super detailed: damage seems to be based on damage per second and not damage per shot, and armor penetration has different levels within the 'light, medium, heavy' that have listed.\nAlso to mention it seems you can't see the stats for call in weapons at all.\nBut right, back to the whole patch note stuff. The lack of detail they give makes it really had to tell if something was meant to be changed, a bug, or was even changed at all. Like the for mention \"steering lock\" isn't actually new to me, I've been having that issue since launch week on the PS5",
      "Due to the steering lock, I spawned into the water on the new map, that was super fun!\n\nI honestly don't understand why they would make this horrible change. Sure, being on top of things \"might\" be an advantage, but is it that horrible if some people decide to stand on a rock or similar? \n\nAre they going to nerf jump pack next so you can't get on top of things. \n\nReally unnecessary...",
      "What’s steering lock?",
      "That's been my biggest shock with the development of this game. The number of \"stealth\" changes... only to be confirmed by the dev team. Like, if you are going to sneak shit in, the last thing you want to do is confirm you did it. That makes it all so much worse. Just put it all in the patch notes. We may not like it all, but lying is so, so much worse.",
      "it can also be avoided if we had access to patch information IN GAME. like, what the fuck is the Bureau even *for!?* there's no enemy codex, no patch notes, nothing. if they just add this, people will be able to log in and read changes from the comfort of their Super Destroyer, instead of needing a second tab or device open nearby..\n\nbonus points if an in-lore explanation is given first as a message from high command, and then you can also skip to the actual patch notes at the bottom. would also make for fun reading between missions.",
      "Is steering lock when you can’t control the direction your pod is falling? If so that’s been in the game before this patch.",
      "Its a weird position to champion, blaming it entirely on the devs. People could treat these things normally; get the information, test the information thoroughly, then propagate the reality of the information, instead of trusting literally everything they see.",
      "Battlefield does this and I hate it. Every single patch there's a mega thread for changes found that we're not announced. \n\nThis is bad. This is wrong. This is not how you do patch notes.",
      "Whoever wrote the patch note, clearly did not do a good job at writing it and communicate with the dev team that make the changes.",
      "Genuinely, if there is no steering lock why and I being prevented from moving in certain directions? Yes I have power steering unlocked but I have been able to move in certain directions to try and hit bugs or other targets.\n\nLast night I had to land away from the EP because I couldn't steer my pod towards it. Now before that I had my controls completely locked up preventing changing my course at all but that I thought was a bug.",
      "Why do people keep calling the \"steering lock\" change disinformation? I just booted up the game and you can't land on cliffs or ledges any more. They obviously changed it.",
      "Lol they couldnt even tell the playerbase that their cross play dosent work properly for like 2 weeks. Expect them to do more changes behind the scenes in the future",
      "The steering lock thing is the dumbest “anti-fun” thing they’ve added to the game. It makes no sense. The trade off of landing on a high unreachable position is that you can no longer do the objective. That’s enough of a trade off. Let me land on top of cliffs",
      "Still people here praise the devs for not providing proper patchnotes. *“It‘s more fun to find out yourself“* they say - it’s not, this way you only got false informations.",
      "\"It is your fault somebody else lied\" is a pretty bold take.",
      "Hellpod steering seems to be pretty buggy as well and I haven't seen that acknowledged anywhere. Been since launch that sometimes your pod will just hard steer one way and you can't control it. Other times it seems like I don't have power steering anymore.",
      "Does anybody else after the patch has its weapons go to the default ones each time you start the game? Also all the starter prompts on screen are always showing up each time I start the game.",
      "Meanwhile, on the new mission. I have a talent for steering directly into the pits of water.  Death by cannonball!",
      "Steering lock isn't false information tho. It absolutely exists and has since the game came out. Iv lost count of how many times my pod felt like it's had a mind of its own, Steering hard to one side while I'm trying to get it to go another way. On multiple occasions iv wanted to go one way to land on an enemy, and the pod goes the complete opposite direction. It's very annoying.",
      "I've been thinking there was a stealth nerf to the 500kg bomb, the aoe is tiny compared to to explosion, and it doesn't do anything to a titan unless its DIRECTLY above the bomb.\n\nAnd even then sometimes it doesn't even kill",
      "The Steering lock sucks anyway since most enemies can climb the tallest hills in the game.",
      "There is a difference between keeping new content a secret and drastically altering how people play the game already WITHOUT proper accounting and patch notes. I booted up the game last night only to find out that my Recoiless Rifle wasn’t boofing Chargers in the face anymore after smacking them in that pretty mouth of theirs. Then I found out about some stealth changes to make you aim much higher. I picked it up, sure, and killed like five chargers with a high-placed dome shot, but that sort of shit? It isn’t okay. \n\n“I want to discover the game organically.” *retardbobmocking.jpg*\n\nCool. That’s fine. Then never read the patch notes. Bam. Mystery secured. You can also never tap you ‘Tab’ button to look up weapon stats either. That is YOUR prerogative. You can ignore the stats and patch’s notes all you want, but me and hundreds of thousands of other players? We want shit documented. If AH makes a change that affects the gameplay, then it needs to be documented. For transparency and bug tracking purposes. Because AH has introduced just as many new bugs for every bug they solve, and if we have an idea as to what is being changed then we can help bug hunt. \n\nAlso, I’d like to see the stats on my weapons and stratagems. I’d like to know the range. “If I throw this 50m away then I know I won’t get my teammates killed”, that way if it bounces off a rock or falls short then I can say “RUUUUN!!!!!! D4! Runnnnnnn!”\n\nThis whole “I want to discover things on my own” wave is just the damndest thing I’ve ever seen; this isn’t a damn exploration game with secrets and hints and shit. It’s a cooperative PVE shooter with guns and explosions and tons of friendly fire. And if the changes are going to invalidate a weapon or stratagem then the players deserve to know about it rather than hopping into a 7+ match and finding out that their EATs and Recoiless has suddenly become incredibly inconsistent until they “discover” that they now have to hit the face in a specific way or else they’ll take less damage.\n\nBut those changes are made in a stealth patch, that you don’t even know about until after the fact. \n\nThis isn’t an anime girl *headbonk* “I forgot to put these changes in there, tee-hee.” *wink* situation. \n\nLet AH be the transparent company they want to be, and stop making excuses for them when they fuck up. Or fall short.",
      "Yeah and I don’t know why people think it was even a stealth change. FFS shit like this is 100% unintended and it takes exactly 1 second to understand that it is. Of course they didn’t ADD a BS feature like this. It’s a bug, and it’s been happening to me since launch, even after buying that ship module upgrade that gives you better steering. Someone noticed it for the first time, posted misinformation, and a bunch of people just ran with it. FFS having a game community this big only ensures that there’s stupid ass opinions and pure misinformation.",
      "Give us what you have changed mechanically in the game in the patch notes, leave all the hidden new enemies and missions for us to find on our own.",
      "You know you're just as bad outwardly saying something is misinformation when you don't know that to be the case either. People are experiencing it more often, that's why they're saying it's been stealth patched",
      "Yet someone just told me these devs were \"some of the best at communicating they've ever seen\". Reddit is a trip and a half.\n\nI can't help wondering how much of the railgun nerf drama we could have maybe side-stepped too, if the devs had told us the other AT options had been buffed. \n\nThe good news is it seems like they may have learned from that. Calling them \"unfortunately undocumented changes\" kind of implies they intend to document changes like that in the future. I hope.",
      "Have yet to work at a single company with good documentation for code. Even if the devs wanted to, sometimes there are just unforeseen and untested cases that change the end product and they don't know until it's in production. Not an excuse just a more realistic view from my experience ",
      "To all gamers everywhere, in my years playing online games/live service games I have never met a studio to ever post 100% of the changes they made to patch notes. Why you may ask as it's there game, we'll they don't know thats the problem.  No one person handles the list of changes, and if someone makes a change and forgets to add it, or it gets added to an old draft someone does not know about thats why. It's not done on purpose gaming company's truly are not 100% organized to note ever change. Mind you there is always changed made when code is adjusted that they have no idea even changed something. Lots of factors. Just a some 2 cents thats all.",
      "I mean, since day 1 , this community like to make false assumption and spread rumour with 0 basis.  Just remember the whole \"farmer are killing the war effort\" whining that occured for weeks. Haven't seen a single apologies or mea culpa from anyone here tho.\n\nWe are trash as a community, it's the only explanation i got.\n\nI do agree that some thing could be communicated in a clearer way tho. \n\nThat being said, do you want the dev working on fixing bug, or working on documenting the fix they made ? Because that's also what's at stake here.",
      "Steering lock is on.\n\nYou can't drop on top of structures anymore.\n\nThe upgrade to control the pod is useless now, refund me my samples.\n\nWhy remove fun things like this from the game? It hurt nobody. You can't stay on top or rocks forever. \n\n#THIS SUCKS",
      "Can you guys go 5 seconds without whining and moaning? I’m trying to enjoy the game",
      "So you mean to tell me, the steering thing was a bug after all?",
      "Did no one see the post that at least the changes to EAT/recoilless wasn't supposed to be stealth? The dev team forgot to put it on the note they gave to the community team",
      "I think they also stealth patched my game into crashing to desktop less than five minutes after launch every time I try to play it",
      "Stop FAKE NEWS",
      "I readily believed it just because of how powerful exploiting the higher ground is in this game. Something's gotta change eventually.",
      "My theory is that the people making the changes and the people writing the patch notes are not the same. Balance team makes changes and adjustments but doesn't write them all down, then the patch team has to try and figure out what got changed.\n\n\nThings like the EAT/Recoilless dealing full damage at all angles feel like changes that were made because they weren't functioning as intended, but then weren't reported to the patch team.",
      "It's really got the community on edge and it's just a poor practice for a live service game",
      "EAT and recoilless changes weren't exactly stealth. They were mentioned the next day after patch 100 on discord by devs. They most likely actually forgot to include them.\n\nWhy it wasn't added to the existing patch log I don't know, maybe steam doesn't allow changing already posted notes.",
      "Yeah the steering lock to keep people from getting on top of things is annoying, so much so youre basically locked in place so the destroyer upgrade of steering is almost a pointless purchase now",
      "I love stealth changes because they help prevent online communities from crying about every little thing before they even try it. It used to be that every element of a game wasn’t “solved” a day after release. Stealth changes help preserve some of the mystery of a game. Younger games won’t understand this because they seem to believe they need perfect information to optimize every second of playtime ",
      "I think people gotta stop caring so much about this stuff. This ain't war zone. Just play.",
      "Ya know this isn’t a PSA.  It’s to a very specific group not the public?  They don’t even owe you basic ass patch notes much less complete ones… GTFO",
      "Devs “we want players to use the pods for combat”\nAlso Devs “oh no, they are having fun, lock the pods”",
      "The steering lock is listed as a known problem in the patch notes. Which means misinformation will spread with or without it being explicitly mentioned in patch notes",
      "Don't give a fuck about patch notes, because this game has single handedly renewed my love for gaming and reconnected me with old gaming friends.",
      "I would be fine with stealth buffs (to a certain degree) but not stealth nerfs.",
      "It is kinda an integral part of the game. I just regret spending the super samples im not good at the ga me. ",
      "I forget what game did it, but whenever a patch had some kind of stealth change I remember the notes would simply have the change, but censor the changes. The notes would be re-released without the censoring later once people had a chance to experience the change without it being spoiled.\n\nWith this game's tone, immersion friendly patch notes could be released with some notes being redacted or partially redacted, with keywords what the bullet point is focused on, or vague descriptions could be used instead. \n\n\"New reports of what appear to be Stalker lairs having mutated.\"\n\nIs this about Stalkers stealth being reworked? Or possibly the >!Shrieker lairs?!< The whole point is it you're now on the lookout for Stalker lairs and know there will be *something* different, but without spoiling what.\n\n\"EAT and Recoilless rockets have been [- - - - REDACTED - - - -] according to [- - - REDACTED - - -] by order of [REDACTED]. Please provide feedback to your nearest supply officer after sufficient testing.\"\n\nThis could be used for either the no glancing shots buff, or even the Charger nerf signaling players to test the weapons again. Something has changed with the weapons, the devs have done their job telling us that, and now we get to have fun tinkering with them to figure out what and whether or not it was effective.",
      "I like discovering changes on my own? I think.. it's tough to say for sure. Surprises are always nice, but sometimes you feel like you're being gaslit when your favorite weapon doesn't work the same way it used to",
      "Not sure what you are on about, this issue have been since day 1 and happens randomly for me since then. I can still land on high stuff without issues, the issue happens in open spaces as well.\nSome probably got it more often now than before? But the issue was def not added now.",
      "They changed the colors of the SEAF rockets as well. Double yellows no longer a thing, smoke was turned black and pointy.",
      "I think the issue is there is no communication happening at Arrow Head. They're told to make some changes and teams are independently making changes and then when its time to put patch notes or release notes together they just say \"so what did you work on\" and someone says \"uhhh i don't remember, but next week i'm working on this\" and then the change they worked on gets left out.",

      "I wonder if a lot of the \"stealth changes\" were actually kept secret on purpose, or if they simply forgot to include them in the patch notes lol. Could also be that the devs are still recovering from working on the server issues, and only put what they thought was \"important\" in the patch notes. \n\nEither way, I don't think the stealth changes are a huge deal and I'm sure they'll try to be more honest now with stuff like that.",

Let's say they change how an explosive weapon works suddenly, and they want to see if it gets more kills. Since they didn't say they buffed it, the amount of people using the explosive DID NOT CHANGE. So they have more reliable/consistent data. Publicly state you buffed it, then viola, twice as many people are using it. Now your data has no reference point.\n\nSteering lock I could argue should be publicly noted.

      "Something is odd since the last patch. I dropped in last night holding right to avoid landing in a swarm but the pod pulled hard left on its own, really jarring when a game is obviously not respecting the controller input",
      "Yes but they made it stronger. Noticed it playing last night too, multiple times I was forced to land into a corner filled with enemies because there was just a small barrier next to me and it's where my reinforcement was thrown. I would have been able to land on it prior but now I'm forced into the ground.",
      "I think it's happening more now, but I was getting it locking every 3-4 respawns anyway.",
      "I’m not for bitching about changes and what not, but I have noticed the steering of the pods have been insane since the recent patch. I’ll get tossed way off the side and even out of the zone. I have noticed though- it’s during storms… is wind a factor for these things?",
      "Then they need to acknowledge them as such. If the devs had been transparent with mechanical changes from the start, then when something undocumented came up people would assume it was a bug. Arrowhead hasn’t earned that level of trust because they consistently refuse to disclose certain mechanical changes. This goes back to the earliest patches. Because they haven’t been forthcoming, people assume any changes are just another thing they’re trying to hide.\n\nEdit: Holy shit, the number of people who apparently can’t follow a comment longer than two sentences. How have you concluded I’m saying the devs should know every issue right away? You people are as quick to jump to hysterics as the people saying the railgun nerf ruined the game.",

      "No. Yet people are still kicking off. We literally have a Redditor's post being taken as gospel and presented as fact, with karma farming posts presenting reactions to a possible bug.\n\nAnd asking for folks to chill and seek a credibile source? Alien, strange and wrong. Folks have become addicted to drama.",

      "That’s because there’s a glitch that has been here from the start of the game that locks steering, and after the railgun patch trying to go near mountains or buildings pushes you away. I tried multiple time with my friends and at best we barely make it to the edge of a mountain since then.\n\nYou are probably experiencing the glitch that was always there in the open terrain, but as for buildings try again to test it on big mountains and you will see it pushing you away",

It's been in the game since launch but had seemed to be worse since last patch, but we don't know if that was a stealth patch or a bug.\n\nThere's potential reporting bias in that people wouldn't have noticed the bug as often closer to launch because they didn't have the power steering upgrade, and now that they do they can actually feel the difference when a lock happens.",

Things like that are cool additions that benefit from being snuck in.\n\nChanges to existing mechanics that players are already comfortable with should be made aware, but also some responsibility falls on the players. Just because the devs missed a few changes, doesn't give any right to make wild speculations about new changes every time there's a patch. Provide evidence of an experience you had for sure, but don't link that to definite proof of something being changed. Chances are you're very wrong.",

On top of that they've created a very strong sense of community and the communications from them feel more interpersonal than they would for a major AAA game that goes months without communicating any changes at all. They're responsive and try their best to be transparent, even if mistakes happen, they are a very great company when it communication relative to the rest of the industry. I think their great communication comes more from their speed and responsiveness along with their adaptability and the fact they show they listen to feedback.",

I honestly think the whole railgun nerf MASS  complaining could have been avoided if they hadn't also increased Spawns in all missions, not just Exterminate like they stated. I think a lot of people threw their anger on the railgun nerf because Spawns were increased and without knowing about the deflection fix aswell, there were no obvious replacements for the railgun given we were also told that the butt is the weak spot on a charger but it's just a damage sponge lol. (I get it takes full dmg, but its health pool is huge for a \"weakspot\")",

Reddit is a trip and a half.\n\n\"Give a hand and they'll take the whole arm\" These people get a bit more communication than they are accustomed to and instead of being happy they cry that it's not enough. I wouldn't be surprised that we get the bare minimum in the future because of them.",

So until then its probably fair to presume that it's a glitch messing with the system.",
      ">That is a stealth change.

Even formula changes to xp and gold (where applicable). You can gloss over, read about the hero you want or nothing at all. \n\nI'm sure even some pros don't even read the patch notes in its entity sometimes and just play test and might check the notes after the fact to double check something if something is drastically changed. Sure maybe most pros read it but surely not all. \n\nMy point is, to agree with you, is that all changes should be documented and made available. The players have a choice to read all, parts or none of the documentation or patch notes provided. \n\nStealth anything is not cool because then we the player can't properly assess if it's intended, a bug, a feature or something else entirely.\n\nDon't want to be spoiled about new enemies? Don't read the notes. Don't want to be spoiled about stratagems? Don't read the notes. \n\nWhich I think is a bit silly because as someone who's unlocked everything, unless they tell me, why would I check for new stratagems? Or new upgrades?

A month later it was patched out, but the fact remains there is no way on earth the devs could have predicted that happening.\n\nLikewise before acknowledging something they need to collect information to figure out what it is. Does the problem only happen with PC players or console? Is it both? If PC what specs are affected? Is it only when playing solo or co-op or both?\n\nNo company ever goes public before knowing what it is dealing with.",

There being an overwhelming number of Bile Titans and Chargers means you have to *work together* (aka. make a plan with your other teammates; coordinate your stratagem usage - don't have everyone spam their stratagems all at once; set up defensive holds on the chokepoints; etc.) to effectively get rid of all the chaff + bigger threats. With the recent buffs across the board involving the lower health of Charger heads, they should be able to be dealt with by a variety of AT options fairly quickly now - EATs are my new go to for this, but Arc Throwers also work surprisingly well too (5-6 Charger headshots to kill).\n\n\nTo be fair, his experience was largely similar to mine on a first playthrough - not really knowing what to do at first (even though it's relatively simple once you do) and figuring it out as I went. That said, I caught on pretty quick after the first silo (defend the silo against the breaches; hitting the button next to a silo spawns them in). I also didn't make the mistake of trying out a brand new mission type I've never played before on a high diff - like, play the mission on a more relaxed diff so you understand how it works first *before* jumping straight into it on the hardest mode. IMO, you shouldn't be complaining about how the mission spawn rates are or what to do if you don't understand the mission you're dropping into in the first place. Play it on a lower diff first to understand how the mission works - *then* crank up the diff once you have a better idea of what stratagems to take based on whatever plan your team has in mind. \n\n\nSide note: found it pretty funny at the end of the vid how he wants to call out people like myself, trying to defend high spawn rates on a mission that it's intended for, and a very high difficulty. Maybe don't go into your very first attempt at a new mission completely blind on a challengingly high difficulty next time - learn how the god damn mission works first.\n\n\n**EDIT:** Spelling corrections.\n\n**EDIT 2:** Corrections made regarding diff level - Ermz didn't play on Helldive, but on level 8. My point still largely stands though - diffs 7 - 9 are intended to be difficulties you attempt *after* you've maybe played the mission once or twice to understand what's going on first. OFC, the spawn rates for enemies will be lower on lower diffs - but the principle of *\"hitting a silo button spawns breaches\"* still applies, regardless of diff level.",
      "Yeah, saw someone today (might have been emrz, actually) that complained that two chargers \"spawned out of thin air\"... when you could clearly see them burrowed down in the ground by the objective he was going to, and see them emerging from the ground when he got closer.\n\nI mean... just paying like 10% attention to the game will tell you all this.",

      "There are different things happening. Before this patch you would occasionally not be able to move your pod. This was entirely different then what the guy you responded to. However, you COULD land on top of mountains or buildings. \n\nIn the last patch they added invisible walls around mountains or buildings that are tall and you can not move on top of them anymore. \n\nEven tiny outcroppings on termind planets now stop you from moving and it feels like you have far less control when coming down now. It's also far more frequent due to the amount of small mountains that dot the terminid maps.",

      "They're hard to notice in Fenrir' lighting, so I guess that's why people think they changed smth about their camo",
      "I truly don't understand people asking for the Stalkers to be less visible. They're already capable of surprising you when dealing with the swarms that show up in higher difficulty. Making them so invisible that you can't see one until the moment before it's in melee range turns encountering stalkers from a skill check into a \"do you have stims\" check.\n\nPlus their visibility is currently part of the balancing act: they can destroy you if they aren't dealt with and they do need to be prioritized, but you don't have to search the entire map to find them if you're paying attention.",

That’s what I mean\n\nFor example, damage + armor pen ability of a gun -> tell the player the values\n\nwhich parts of the bugs have which armor and health pools -> let the player figure out. \n\n  In my opinion that’s half experience of playing a new game. Otherwise it’s like loading up elden ring and just following a guide through the game. Sure you’re playing the same game but you lose the sense of discovery that made the game so good.",
      "Yeah they can, so why dont they go that instead of trying to change the things I enjoy? \n\nGame has worked fine without damage numbers since launch. Why would we need them?\n\nNewsflash: If you play the game you actually paid money for and use the weapons, you start to understand how much damage they do without damage numbers. Madness!\n\nNot every game needs damage numbers so some OCD theorycrafter can suck all the fun out of the game with \"well ackshually\" when they bought the game the day before.",
      " a better compromise is to just post all notes then use spoiler tags on the juicy bits that way you know if you want to know. if you don't wanna be spoiled don't read it and obviously stay off the internet.",
      "As I said, it's impossible to make everyone happy, because nobody is every going to agree on anything really.\n\nIn my case I have so little freetime to play games that I want to know absolutely everything and have everything worked out solved and figured out so that I don't waste my precious 1 hour of free time every other day to play trying to figure something out.\n\nI get not everyone is in my situation, and I don't have a problem with that. Hell I understand perfectly why some people hate spoilers and respect it. Imagine going to the theaters back in May of 1980 waiting in line only to hear someone walking out say 'Can you believe Darth Vader is Lukes father?' lol",
      "You would be surprised how easy it is to accidently spoil something sometimes. Some years ago a friend was watching a show I had recommended to them, and they were telling me about the episode they had just watched, before mentioning quite literally a major event from the next episode that was not in the preview.\n\nI asked how they knew that happened since they said they never looked at spoilers and hadn't watched the next episode yet, resulting in them getting pissed off for spoiling it.\n\nAgain, they literally predicted something out of the blue that had ZERO foreshadowing and NO hints OR buildup with perfect 100% accuracy.\n\nHow on earth was I suppose to know it was a blind guess?",

      "Oh yeah. For real they need to fix this FAST. It happens to me probably 4 times per mission and my friends just as much.",
      "What? Again, that’s not official information. You are referring to the fact that you can’t land directly on top of objectives. The problem of not being able to control the steering of your hellpod when landing/respawning is a separate thing entirely, WHICH IS A BUG",

I then pointed to a particularly infamous example of this happening, followed by the conclusion that no company ever goes public before they have all the information.\n\nPossibility 1: The change was the unintended result of changing something entirely unrelated.\n\nPossibility 2: The change is in fact a fix for something players were unintentionally able to do. (Mass Effect 3's infinite COBRA glitch)\n\nPossibility 3: Something is causing the perception of a change when it is something entirely unrelated, such as a change in 'vehicle' controls back end coding.\n\nPossibility 4: Sunspots/solar storms causing ass lag in online games again.\n\nPossibility 5: You are a bug sympathizer.",

      "It definitely has gotten worse, but it's hard to say *why.*  The power steering lock/sloping could be the devs adding more protections to certain objectives that they don't want players to helldive (E.G. automaton command bases, bile titans, etc,) which in turn added bugs to the procedural map generation, causing other objectives to have erroneous no-fly zones.\n\nBut it has also, absolutely, been in game since launch.  It just has definitely become more prevalent over time.",

Someone THINKS (keyword here) something was \"stealth changed\". They make a post similar to that popular one with all those things that MIGHT (another keyword) have been changed, but in reality those things werent actually chaged. That person doesn't know for sure and just spreads misinformation. People are now complaining about something that was not changed. \nWhat do you expect to be done in that situation? Nothing was actually changed yet people think it was. Should the devs mention everything they did (this is a given, report what you changed) and DIDNT (I asked this in my last comment as well, but it was also glossed over) change? Nothing is stopping people from just guessing that something might, maybe, could possibly have been changed. ",

      "Yeah, for me with my eyes being hyper sensitive to any motion, I spot them easy as shit. Never had one kill me, only been launched twice. Even now, I still have no issues.\n\nBut that's because I am really good at tracking any motion or change at all. I have walked face first into spitters because they were standing still on my screen. If it moves, I see it. If it doesn't, my brain has it as lower priority and I may walk face first into them. \n\nAnd some people will be the opposite, extremely aware of stationary targets but not good at spotting the movement of a Stalker in stealth. \n\nEveryone's brains work a bit differently.

The only way I wouldn't see them is if I get blindsided by one because I'm dealing with something else.\n\nTheir camo is a joke.

      "They already are \"Do you have stims\" checks.  Stalkers move in a straight line from their hive, but the hives are less-visible on the map and they typically start running in from the side anyways.  The frequent hordes make it impractical to constantly check in all directions, leading to stalkers feeling incredibly bullshit compared to their HD1 variants.\n\nThat said, these days, they're fairly simple to deal with.

Amnounce it isn't true, if it is true, then a \"were looking into it\" will be more than enough.

Personally I run air smoke, EATs, air cluster and orbital rail. It covers everything mostly well and you can be mobile.",
      "There is actually a large amount of people in pubs that are just like that, mostly on Automatons. If the team isn't robust enough to deal with the bots together or get out of the bot drop cycle, that's usually time to break off and lose aggro for yourself, and just get the main objective done. If the other 3 are just stuck in the slog, it's a fairly easy time to fully complete most missions because the game physically is not allowed to call in bot-drops to stop you, especially if you're doing your best to avoid engagement (besides Geological Survey because the drill automatically summons bot drops and frequently drops tanks that block the drill terminal, do not do this on Geo Survey)\n\nIf they're constantly stuck fighting robots and getting bot drops, they're both reaching the spawned unit cap away from the objective and also making the robots use each bot drop cycle on them (as you probably already are not aggrod due to the prior benefits of breaking off, and thus not competing for bot drops at any given moment), making it fairly easy to just walk up to the objective while avoiding static robots at POIs, and clearing static bots on the objectives without them getting help from bot drops or random patrols",

He kept pushing people over at extraction to make them miss the window or TKing, or trying to drop on people so they can’t spawn. The 3rd mission he stood at the entrance and just killed everybody so he only extracted. After that the host killed him at the start of the mission and nobody bothered calling in reinforcements since it was easy and we weren’t really dying except by him.

    "selftext": "I typically play healers, and one thing that annoys me is that I don't actually care what my raw output of healing is, that is a pretty useless stat since every match takes a differen't amount of time, it varies my map, etc. \n\nI would much prefer to have healing always shown as a percentage of team damage taken, since that is what makes a difference. You often see this stat on the voting screen, but it is annoying that I can't check that stat any time I want during the game, so I can actually have a comparable number to judge my performance.\n\nI realize that a percentage might be less flashy then a big number, but it would help me and other players get better at the game which I consider the main purpose of stats. (Disclaimer: I am NOT saying you should base your perfomance entirely on stats, or for certain positions, on stats at all. In many cases, it is detrimental to your performance to do so, however, percentage of team damage taken that you have healed is probably as close to a consistently comparable stat as you could ever get. It is certainly better then elims or damage done, both of which can be more easily skewed by poor behaviour.)\n\nTell me what you think, are there problems to this change I am not considering?",

      "That's actually a great idea and I can't believe I've never thought of this. I know stats mean hardly anything (they mean about as much as gold medals) but I do try to keep my healing percentage above at the very least 30%. It's nice to know mid-game if I'm above that standard. \n\nI can't see any problems to this. There's the obligatory \"what about toxicity\" well the addition of new heroes and maps cause toxicity but I don't see anyone complaining about Oasis or Moira (unless it's deathmatch where that bitch is broken)",
      "Upvoted because I would really love this. % of damage healed is a much better metric than raw numbers. Obviously they track it because it shows up in the cards frequently I don’t think it’d be too hard to add it to the xp screen. ",
      "Why not both?",
      "I kind of like this idea. I've had games where I had what I thought was a very low amount of healing and was a bit upset with my performance... until I realized that the reason my healing was so low was because my team was stomping the opposition with good positioning and actually getting behind the barrier so they weren't actually *taking* all that much damage for me to heal.",
      "This is much better than the system we have now. Some matches I get 12000 healing, and others I get 2000 healing, but that number tells me nothing about how well I'm actually doing.",
      "I like the idea. I’d like to see them side-by-side to help contextualize each other. As a few have mentioned, high percentage but low raw output could be a good sign, but I wouldn’t want to feel upset that I only healed 15% of total damage if my output was like extremely high. That’s probably just a sign of a disorganized team taking too much damage. \n\nWhile we’re thinking of new stats, it’d be interesting to see some sort of “wasted” healing metric for someone like Mercy. It’d be something like time using a healing beam that wasn’t actually healing or something. One thing I’ve learned while playing her is to be damage boosting as much as possible when no one needs immediate healing and something like this could help players see if they’re moving in the right direction. ",
      "I'd like it but in addition to the raw stat rather than replacing it.",
      "Definitely useful. Raw damage for blocked is useful, but I don't think raw healing number is.",
      "The downside to this is that if your team is feeding super hard, running in 2 by 2 and refusing to work together or respond to \"group up\" spam, aka average match in gold, you'll have a really low percentage regardless of the fact that you're healing as much as most healers are able to in a match",
      "[deleted]",
      "I think the healing done stat is the most context neutral actually. If your teammates take a ton of damage and die all the time you'll get a much lower percentage than if they're playing cautiously and dominating the enemy team. But anyways even healing done will greatly vary depending on battlefield conditions , especially for Moira. So , stat tracking should not turn into an obsession.",
      "This is the only reason I go hard for raw healing. To see what my percentage will be. Only the highest healing output in the game will be shown unless another stat of yours trump's it. ",
      "Constantly out of position DPS would have a field day blaming the healer when this stat shows up as low.",
      "I don't think healing % is super reliable either and it doesn't make much of a difference.\n\nHealing output has to do much with team composition. Does your team consist of 3 flankers, a winston and a moira? Or do you have 2-3 beefy, static tanks in front of you and no secondary healer? \nOne lets you get much more healing in than the other\n\nSame goes for the kind of healing. Are you doing really shit in emergency heals, missing critical shots as ana, but you reliable pump in healing darts on an out of combat D.Va? Your healing %/numbers might be high but it doesn't mean much if you let key people die when it counts.\n\nOften having high healing numbers/% also means that you neglect other chores like speedboost, damage boosting etc. \n\nAnother thing is: You can only heal so much. With 3 tanks and 1 healer, if you get 20k heals on koth but that \"only\" makes for 28% damage received - thats still really good, the low percentage is misleading.\n\nHealing numbers/% is nice for the ego and are often a confirmation of a job well done, but it doesn't tell you anything really. \n",

Unfortunately, the only way I can see that stat is if I get a voting card which doesn't always happen. \n\nI don't want to encourage the overuse of stats, but if we are going to have bad stats that dont encourage winning oriented behaviours (elims) then we might as well have slightly better/comparable stats? \n\nHealing per minute/10 minutes is also better then what we have, although ideally we would have consistent access to both. It should also be said that a similar stat could be better for other team roles as well, like percentage of damage to actual kills as a combination stat that doesn't have the problem of counting eliminations where you barely did anything (reaper spraying his pellets from a mile away, or Moira consistently getting gold in elims because her orb touched everybody once) and the inverse although less prevalent issue of doing lots of damage that doesn't actually contribute to a kill (spamming into a roadhog is less helpful then getting actual kills on the other team, etc.) Maybe somebody more clever then me can figure out how to apply this to some of the other stars as well.

If I need stitches those will cost me a fraction of what an ambulance ride would have and, if I lived in an area that disincetivizes personal vehicle ownership then previously my choices were 'tape it up really good myself and hope it doesn't get infected', 'take the bus', 'fork over 3 grand to get me to an emergency room where I'd sit for 4 hours before a doctor would perform a 15 minute procedure that will cost less than $500.'\n\nDeregulating ambulances wouldn't change the basic dynamic here even though it would lower the ambulance costs.\n\nOTOH, deregulation could open up a whole 'nother tier of medical transport service *between* Uber and an ambulance - which would be another win for the market.",

      "and to be fair to people on that sub they're just misguided as they truly hate Crony capitalism which has taken root in the nations like the U.S. but the politicians and pundits just call it capitalism so they begin to think that's what capitalism is, not helped by socialists and anti-capitalists who think crony capitalism is what all capitalism devolves into reinforcing the idea, hence \"late stage capitalism\"",
      "I agree with everything you said, it makes sense that an ambulance would be, and should be somewhat expensive, but if you were to allow multiple parties to serve as ambulances for example, so anybody could act as an ambulance, then the price would be significantly cheaper. \n\nIf I could get my EMT cousin training to be a doctor, lease a van and purchase basic medical equipment, and we could serve as a freelance ambulance starting at $2000 per trip (to undercut the full ambulance cost), working 3 days a week, and limited ourselves only to cases that the dispatcher was able to get clear information that it would be safe for us to transport the patient, even if we only got an average of one job a week, all expenses considered, it would be more then we are making as college students now. \n\nPoint is, if it were open to competition it would not be nearly that expensive.

      "> Deregulating ambulances wouldn't change the basic dynamic here even though it would lower the ambulance costs.\n\nThis is the important part of healthcare that most *laissez-faire capitalism* fetishists just refuse to accept. Healthcare is *expensive* no matter which way you slice it; yes the way the American-Capitalist for-profit healthcare industry is set up, it adds a lot of unnecessary costs, mainly due to having this giant corporate, profit-seeking, investor/shareholder driven monster called the insurance industry.\n\nHowever, no amount of competition or deregulation is going to lower the price of a $200,000 craniotomy to repair an aneurysm down to $19.95 plus shipping and handling.

Their whole worldview is that companies should be subordinate to and dependent upon the state - to be, in effect, unofficial organs of the state.\n\nThey are absolutely for crony capitalism.",
      "I think that you would be seriously underestimating the cost for basic medical supplies to stock an ambulance (Lifepak 15 cardiac monitor set up for standard ALS service starts at $21,000 and goes up depending on options), lease an ambulance, pay a medical doctor to work under their license, pay for the dispatch to classify “qualified” calls that you could transport, pay a billing company to handle all insurance claims and collect on bills.  This doesn’t even begin to touch upon regular ongoing maintenance and costs associated with running a business (fuel, insurance, payroll and taxes, etc.).  \n\n\nThis is just the start in this particular scenario. There are also several logistical factors that would have to be considered in regards to who decides which ambulance service to call based solely on the 911 call, as well as how much time that delays the response to the person calling 911. \n\n\nAdditionally, the majority of government run ambulance services won’t send the patient to collections to collect on an unpaid bill (of course there are some agencies that will do this, but it is far less than private services which use collections as a standard practice to collect unpaid bills). \n\n\nThere are usually several options for private EMS in every city, they provide the majority of intra/inter-facility transports and can be hired to transport you from your house. They generally don’t provide 911 service, simply because if you need and ambulance for an emergency, you want to receive the quickest option.   So there are options and an open market for private ambulance transportation, it’s just limited for emergency response from 911.  If a patient needs a ride to the hospital with some medical care on the way, a private transport might be less expensive than the service provided calling 911, but that’s because calling 911 provides a service at a premium due to the fact that it should be reserved for emergencies. ",
      "They are \"free\", no bill is given to you when you use the service. But one still has to pay their monthly MSP bill.\n\nBut...that amount for an ambulance ride is due to capitalism, for profit healthcare system is stupid.

    "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/a0xg56/the_concept_of_an_external_threat/",
    "selftext": "Fair warning, this is a long one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am somebody who loves minecraft in and of itself. I don't play because I need to meet some objective goal or to accomplish some set task, for me building the cool cities, exploring the world and discovering interesting mods  is the end itself. That said, a mod/modpack concept I have been dreaming of for some time is that of an \"external threat.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMinecraft already has outside \"challenges\" for you to meet. Namely that of the Ender Dragon, Nether, Wither, etc. There are also many mods that add threats of this type, which are good, but what I am looking for is something that requires action. All of those challenges don't require you to meet them, which is completely intentional game design so it allows players to take their time in preparing to meet them. What I am looking for is an encroaching threat, something where inaction will result in punishment and action will result in reward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA good example of this is when you first play Terrafirmacraft, there are the basic threats that minecraft has built in, like hunger and self preservation from local \"predators\" (mobs) just hyped up a little bit, but it really starts to kick in as you realize that *winter is coming* and you actually need to stockpile food, since your food is actively rotting and food will be more scarce. This gives you a sense of urgency and purpose, as you are no longer building just because it looks pretty but because you need a cellar to preserve your limited harvest etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother mod that gave a great outside threat was the old version of Blood Magic (not that I am complaining about the new version at all, I love it) where in the late game, a player could spawn a \"demon invasion\" by creating a portal from which an army of demons would pour, who would not only build a city around the portal dynamically, but would then expand from the portal eventually taking over a 1000 block area. Attacking the demons would result in additional demons being spawned who will counterattack with end game boss fierceness. It was awesome and terrifying. One of my favorite minecraft experiences was spawning a demon invasion on a multiplayer server, near enough to our base that a war ensued that we actually lost. It was still a ton of fun, actually putting automated defenses to use and preparing guerilla warfare assaults to attempt to sneak in and steal resources or eventually to try and attack the portal itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou could also look at other games who try to create this emotion. An excellent example I have seen many suggestions to emulate is \"Frostpunk\", a city building survival game where not only must you expand the city into a hopelessly hostile environment, but the environment is actively getting worse and failing to keep pace with the coming apocalyptic storm will result in death. There have been modpacks and mods that emulate this to some degree by providing a hostile environment, such as the old galacticraft Hardcore adventure pack that involved surviving on the moon, or any skyblock pack, but those lack the encroaching urgency. In the beginning you may need to hurry to make certain resources such as food or oxygen available, but usually once this was overcome there was no longer any threat to worry about, no \"upcoming invasion.\"  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n McJty has recently made the Lost Cities mod which in combination with the \"need to breathe\" mod he also created, allow for a unique challenge where the air outside of natural biospheres is poisonous unless sealed environments with special purifiers are constructed, which is closer to what I am talking about, (I have already experimented with making a pack with this challenge and possibly Tough as Nails with the Serene Seasons mod, which would indeed be challenging.) but still doesn't provide the external oncoming threat I seek. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother game that I think embodies this concept, is the \"Crisis\" events in the end game of Stellaris. In Stellaris, a galaxy spanning grand strategy game, one of many possible \"Crisis\" event occur at a random time later in the game, that will be overwhelmingly powerful and threaten to take over the entire galaxy and may overcome even the strongest of playwr and non player empires. It is a TON of fun, and usually results in a galactic alliance being formed for survival. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Raiders mod I beleive can be configured to work in this regard, although I think it could be better one day. There also used to be a mod that was never updated beyond 1.7.10 that allowed you to set a certain block as an \"objective\" for you to protect, and oncoming waves of mobs to try and destroy, that would provide rewards for successfully repelled enemies. This is much closer to the concept I have in mind.\n\nAnyhow, let me know what mods you are aware of that might contribute effectively to this concept, or cool ideas you have that also might fit the mold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

All evidence shows that he did not have a weapon but the people who is still trying to justify the police just said the police is justified because racial minorities are dangerous. \n\nNow HK isnt exactly like this, but the reasoning of the Maxim is similar to the people trying to justify the police except you can switch out the unarmed racial minority with peaceful protestors, the armed racial minority would be me amongst others who could not stand the police who fired pepper rounds and tear gas at peaceful protestors so we go to the frontlines to defend against police brutality and to do damage to Maxim and MTR",

    "selftext": "So I am visiting my family this weekend, and they are pretty respectful of me as an exmo generally. This evening though, they sit down and want to do their lesson thing which apparently involves watching these story, movie clip things based on the book of mormon. So I decide not to make a fuss and just chill on the couch on my phone as they do their thing. They didn't ask me to be there or anything, but I'm not going to avoid them because they are getting religious, so long as they aren't pushing it on me. \n\nSo they start the lesson with a movie clip, like 10 minutes long, meant to depict some scenes from the book of Nephi. \n\nIt is hilariously incongruous. I don't know if the church leadership or someone thought that putting it in movie format would make it seem real or something, but it just seems like really bad writing, that I wouldn't expect from even the cheapest of TV shows. \n\nKeep in mind I am paraphrasing here, I wasn't paying very close attention. It opens with Nephi and is brothers going to see Ishmael, and Ishmael says \"I wouldn't expect to see you again Laman!\" Laman says \"Me neither, but an angel came to me and my brothers so I am in agreement with my father\" Barely anyone reacts to this, and Ishmael agrees to take his family into the wilderness. They are out in the desert, a few scenes of Laman and Lemuel complaining etc. Then Nephi goes super self righteous, speaking incredibly holy and all that, everyone reacting angrily instead of laughing at him like anyone would, and even if I were a member Nephi would just seem so annoying, and unrealistic. How does everyone react? Oh let's murder our brother! So they beat him up and tie him up, and talk about their evil plan to take him in the wilderness so he will be eaten by animals. Then as they are walking away, like as no time has passed, Nephi prays and his ropes just fall off of him. Nephi walks up to everyone and they are all angry and then suddenly Laman breaks down all sorry and begging for forgiveness, more mood whiplash and etc. Etc. \n\nIt is honestly just funny to see with how my family watches this and somehow thinks it is realistic and believable, when it just seems like super crappy writing to me.",

      "Oh, those are *TERRIBLE*!  TBM DW kind of foisted the first lesson on me and our youngest a few weeks ago, no prior warning or discussion.  They were so silly and dumbed down to a kindergarten level of dialogue, but at the same time kind of modernized, trying to achieve some level where adults could relate. \n\n*Nephi enters a tent where Lehi is waiting for him* (I’m paraphrasing here, but this is how the dialogue came across).  Lehi: “Oh hi, Nephi, have a seat.”  Nephi: “You wanted to talk to me, dad?”  Lehi: “Yes, yes.  I need you to go back to Jerusalem and get those brass plates from Laban.”  Nephi:  “Okay, should I take Laman and Lemuel with me?”\n\nPlus the little forward before each video segment that says (again I’m paraphrasing, and really don’t want to sit through any more of them to get the exact wording) “These are ACTUAL events that took place in the Book of Mormon, something something...”.  If you look ay them carefully, they’re weasel words that say “These are historical events” to children and incredulous believers, but if the church is pressed on the historicity of the book, they can say “No, we said they were actual events that *took place in the BoM*, we never said they were actual *historical* events!”\n\nAnyways, that first lesson was so dumb DW hasn’t revisited the topic since.",
      "I watched a part of it.  \n\nAnd I got as far as a scene where Nephi was being beaten up by Laman and Lemuel,  who then got sternly rebuked by Lehi - and they immediately went to Nephi and got down on their knees and humbly begged his forgiveness.\n\nThe scene was so ludicrous, I burst out laughing, and turned it off.  It was all I could handle.  Talk about bad writing!  Joe, if you're gonna write a bad novel, at least learn a little psychology first!",

      "I know people have mentioned filling tubes to the top already, but I was also told to fill all buckets (so if you only need two tubes spun down but have six buckets, make sure the extras are filled with water tubes).\n\nI’ve also never, ever used tubes anywhere near the RPM I’m used, especially since my ultra has dials and no digital display, so we’re kinda guessing at actual speed when you go between tick marks. For example, if I run something at 40k RPM then I’ll use tubes rated for 100-200k. I know it’s expensive but at the time I was doing this all, my PI agreed with me, luckily. \n\nWe don’t reuse tubes, ever. Reusing tubes at high speeds can cause breakage too. \n\nEven with these things in mind, I still came back to crushed tubes once, even though my speed seemed fine because there’s another component: time. I know you said 90 minutes so you should be good but when I was doing 16-25 hour spins, tubes would break a lot too. \n\nThe other thing I would suggest, but honesty don’t know how important it is, when I was trained, we had to weigh-match tubes to three decimal places. So a 30.573g tube couldn’t go across from something 30.579g, they had to weigh as close to each other as possible. That might be more of a very particular ultracentrifuge owner though, haha.",
      "To add to this, if you don’t want to/can’t fill them all the way you can switch to thick wall rigid tubes which will tolerate partial fill. Alternatively, you can lay mineral oil over the top of the sample to fill the overly large tubes of your desired sample is to be in the pellet.\n\nEdit: Beckman specifically says don’t use oil in UltraClear tubes in their SW28 manual.",

    "title": "The Tank Crisis Cascade: Why the lack of tanks became a problem, and why it is getting worse.",
    "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/d71l7b/the_tank_crisis_cascade_why_the_lack_of_tanks/",
    "selftext": "As everyone may have noticed, there is a distinct shortage of tank players in Overwatch. DPS players have 20-30 minute que times, and tanks que instantly. I would like to discuss some of the reasons this has happened, and the reasons why it will continue to get worse unless blizzard intervenes somehow. \n\n1. **Tank gameplay is unconventional.** *\"Normally\"* this is where everyone talks about how tank isn't as fun as the other roles. On this I actually disagree, tank *can* be a lot of fun. Personally I come from a strategy game background, and I really enjoy the emphasis that the tank role brings to anticipating the enemy team, and analyzing situations to make decisions. Tanks are powerful at controlling space, and can control engagements and battle in general, this means that simple seeming decisions like positioning, timing, and targeting can have bigger consequences for the team fight then other roles which tend to have a greater emphasis on survival or killing. As a result, playing tank is *really different* from other shooter game type roles, where there is a more consistent feedback cycle between skill and results. Conclusion: Tanking can be fun, but the majority of people who play Overwatch aren't familiar with or looking for this style of gameplay. \n\n2. **Tanking as a position lacks variety, and is relatively punishing.** Obviously, tanking and healing have far fewer characters then DPS. All tanks and healer character combined, don't equal the number of DPS characters. Consider on top of this, that tank mechanics tend to be relatively homogeneous. Blizzard has taken a step in the right direction with Sigma and Wrecking Ball, but especially when a \"Main Tank\" is always necessary and the meta revolves around Orisa first, and Reinhardt second, there just isn't as much to do nor as much unique appeal as DPS, where you have snipers, Pharah, Mei, Junkrat, Tracer and Torb all with very unique mechanics. A wide array of tools, compared to the 3-5 options maintains have (only 2 of which are actually considered meta.) Another factor here is that tank gameplay is extremely punishing of mistakes. When you make a mistake as DPS and die early you definitely hurt your odds of your team winning, but it is still winnable. If you make a mistake as tank, your team loses the vast majority of the time. This makes tnaking really hard to learn, since of you try playing as tank, and your team does badly, you lose the match quickly and have very little desire to keep playing. With DPS, it is not nearly as punishing to make mistakes, but can be at least as rewarding with huge playmaking potential even outside of ultimates. Yes, tank ults are really strong, but they also tend to be difficult to use requiring a high degree of team coordination to capitalize on. Grav, shatter, D.Va bomb, or even sigma grav are all very negotiable and do little if your team doesn't follow up. Meanwhile a dragon strike, Atrack Visor, Tracer bomb etc. are all far easier to use solo, especially in the lower ranks, and unfortunately while the high ranks determine how the game is played, the low ranks determine who continues to play. New players tend to think that Zarya grav and Shatter are crummy ults, with D.va bomb being the exception. This leads to a way lesser desire gunplay these characters when you could have play making moments like a huge riptire or a last minute blizzard. Tanks just aren't flashy compared to DPS, despite being just as important to game outcomes.\n\n*Interlude:* Tanks being unconventional and not fun for the normal shooter crowd should not be enough to sink the ship, it might lead to fewer tanks in general but motivations like lower que times, unique gameplay, and different skill sets should help balance that out, unless we consider how an initial lack of players could cause knock on effects.\n\n3. **Switching to role que made the game much harder, and dropped average SR's for most tanks.** So before role que, the way comp worked is if you got lucky and had a mai. Tank, on your team, you were set. This formed a positive feedback loop where players would want to play tank and get good at it so they won more games. Back at this time, people who played tanks got a lot of positive feedback in the form of disproportionately high SR, since they had fair games disproportionately often. The alternative was that a DPS or Healer main would fill tank, which was also good for tank mains because this meant they were often playing against other tanks who weren't as familiar or expert in the role. Long story short, tank SR was inflated before role que. \n     Now, role que kicks in, and a few things happen. First, tanks SR is now no longer being compared to that of all other players, but that of other tanks. This means that you are being compared to a much much smaller group of players. Second, you are now playing other tanks who were actually rated at the same role. People who are at least as proficient as you and not filling from a DPS score that is \"carrying\" their tank score. This makes the game harder. Another issue that arises here is that with the game basically always desperately waiting for tank players, you end up being mismatched in terms of SR much more often. Tank players can end up against much better, or much worse teams which in general adds a degree of randomness that makes the game less enjoyable. Then if course, simply having fewer players and reducing the buffer of players below them who never played tanks also reduces many tank players SR.\n\n4. **lower SR's, tougher matches, and low variety all reduce rewards making the game less fun, leading to tank players playing less then before, beginning the cascade. ** This is where the real problem happens. Many tank players, particularly those whose SR's were inflated by non'role que, (which includes myself) had their SR's drop as a result of role que. Most people have gone through the experience if having a bad night, losing a lot of SR, and rage quitting. Basically, air think this has been happening in slow motion across tank players. The only motivator to play tank over other roles is the short que times. If you start to feel like you are bad at your role, especially if you feel like you are somehow Getting worse, you are going to be motivated to do something else. Like a different role, or different game. Again. This in itself isn't so bad, but consider the consequence of a *shrinking* tank playerbase. Basically, tank players start having the floor drop out from under them. Their SR keeps getting worse, meanwhile the tanks they are playing against get *better.* this is what worries me, since this isn't a situation that gets resolved as the SR system adjusts, it gets worse. Thus you have the cascade. SR's get lower, players get more frustrated, the playerbase shrinks. \n\nIn conclusion, all these factors serve to perpetuate eachother. Constricting tank playerbase makes the role less fun, less fun shrinks it further, ad infinitum. I am concerned that if blizzard does not intervene, the spiral will only get more severe, and the crisis I'll only worsen. I know this is a complicated issues, and this is **NOT** a critique of role que. On the whole, role que made gameplay much more fun for tank players, with consistent matches and better matchmaking, but the consequences of switching from not role que to role que I think introduced a viscous cycle that needs to be reversed. Solutions for reversing it include adding **many** more tank characters. Variety greatly incentivizes play in a role, particularly new variety. There doesn't have to be as many tanks as DPS, but an injection of 3 or 4 new tank characters in a relatively short time might be enough to reverse the constricting tank playerbase and motivate inavtice players to come out of their shells, or better yet players to switch roles. Ya, there are potential balance issues from such a rapid adjustment, but role que helps make balance more controllable and the problems to player enjoyment would be countered by the benefits of a bigger tank playerbase. \n\nThanks for reading, sorry it was a long one.\n\nEdit: Yes, I am aware that double barrier meta is a huge factor in how unexciting tank is at the moment, but I think Blizzard knows that one. Another major factor making tank tough is there is a big difference between main tank and off tank, definitely bigger then the difference of any other 2 sub roles. This can also cause frustration, when you want to be one but are paired with the other, and it further reduces variety. Basically because Main tank and off tank are such different roles, (and in the current meta you have to have a main tank always) tanks have even fewer options per game. Often having to switch to something they don't want because the utility is so essential.",

      "the reason why tank players are dwindling is because double shield is not fun for most people, and orisa DEFINITELY isnt fun for most players. but if you play anything else, you just get blown up. you're right in that there is no variety in tank heroes, but part of the reason that those are the only two viable tanks is because cc and damage is power crept so hard, any other tank just dies too fast.",
      "> Switching to role que made the game much harder, and dropped average SR's for most tanks. \n\nI don't really agree there. Playing tank was as hard before role lock, and often even harder. Yes, with one tank being there, the team composition is better on average – but that's only on paper. In reality, just being a tank isn't enough. 2-2-2 with a bad tank is a worse comp than triple DPS.\n\nAlso, SR is by its nature self-correcting. If there was a way to gain rank without having the required skill, the tank player would be faced with DPS and enemy tanks that outclass him, leading to sure losses. Make no mistake, even a gold DPS can render a bronze tank useless. And there were bronze tank mains.",
      "I agree with most of what you’ve laid out, but I actually don’t think there’s much to worry about. Role queue is still new and people are still adjusting. Most of the problems with tanking are growing pains of the game fundamentally shifting, and will largely be solved with time- more people will get used to tanking and also more tanks will inevitably be added to the game.",
      "I don't think any kind of gameplay change is going to make tanks more fun, or less annoying to deal with. If tanks are too strong, then they're just super DPS. If tanks are too weak, then they're worthless things you're dragging across the finish line, and that nobody wants to play. \n\nTanking is an undesirable role for the majority of the playerbase. That's fact. The queues prove it. I think a fundamental re-examination of what the role of a tank is will be needed at some point. A 1 Tank, 3 DPS, 2 Support role queue mixed with buffs to make each tank the defensive equivalent of 1.5x the current average tank power level, for example. Alleviates the pressure on the DPS role both in popularity and performance, keeps games moving fast, but doesn't make the role worthless for the people that really enjoy the gameplay. Maybe reclassify certain DPS as tanks (Mei, for example) for extra variety. Removal of the second tank kills the staggered shield trend, because no single tank (even one with a 50% stronger shield) can keep it up forever on their own against 3 DPS. Except maybe Orisa, who needs to be toned down anyway.\n\nOr maybe something else. I don't know. What I do know is that while I will play tank for my group sometimes, I often feel like I'm just there to expedite the queues for the people playing the more dynamic and enjoyable roles.",
      "\\> On the whole, role que made gameplay much more fun for tank players, with consistent matches and **better matchmaking**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is literally not possible. Haven't played S18 but it's already noticeable in QP when you run a higher mmr (mostly just a lot of games in qp tend to result in higher ratings, just compare ranked ratings of the ppl you get queued with in QP)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore rolelock you got the typical 3-4dps in qp and games were derp because of teams but now you have 2-2-2 and you instantly notice that you get matched with ppl far below your rating because otherwise you cannot get the same queue time. I just need to look at my rolemate for more than 5s and i get a headache. It's like Blizz matches two ppl by role together because apparently i get someone super-low to outbalance me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShortly before rolelock they changed the queue to fit and it's blatantly obvious when queue times suddenly drop to 5s from 30s.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey simply had to lower the quality of the matches (even more...) to provide proper queue times. We lack players and there is no magic solution to this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRIght now you either have short queuetimes or proper matchmaking, not both.",
      "20 minutes queues are 100% lies, had to say it because I play at all times, early morning all the way through late at night never had one that was even 10 minutes. Really needed to say it because I'm so sick of seeing fellow gamers lie because they think they should have things the way they want it and no other way. \n\nInb4 made up times to flex how long you wait. You don't need to lie to impress people.",
      "Funny because people were saying the exact same of dive. There's just no pleasing people.",
      "Ya, it could be as simple as adding in some sort of shield negation tank to the game, which would make off tanks more valuable again since they don't rely so heavily on barriers. Think Symmetra but maybe apple to project zones that damage shields exclusively, or a main tank with the equivalent of old old symmetra that gives bonus shield health to allies in a radius so there is still the engagement of shooting other characters/clicking heads, but some of the utility of a main tank. I feel like that was some of the idea behind brig, but they made her a \"healer\" which fucked everything up. (And made her stun the focus of her kit, rather then her armoring utility.)",
      "I wonder if Shield Meta would get broken by making a few abilities pass through shields. Roadhog hook , Ana Sleep , Zarya either left click (%50 of the damage goes thru the shield) or right click. Essentially strengthening other tanks and healers against the shield meta where they can counter it from medium range but without the huge killing power behind it.",
      "The solution is to just ignore the shields. Run teams that don’t give a fuck if the enemy has 2 shields. It might not work in pro level play but it works quite well outside of it. As far as pro play goes, buff hero’s that ignore shields to encourage teams to just roll through the bunker as a group. Double shield really wants you to stay at medium to long range, you don’t have to give them what they want.",
      "How to fix the supershield meta? The problem, at its core, is probably reaper.  If you haven’t noticed, Orisa Sigma is the strongest tank combo because fortify and kinetic grasp are the best abilities for tanks against reaper.  Other than that, it’s not like sigma and Orisa have some incredible synergies that make them nearly must picks. Orisa can hold the frontline while Sigma shields off flankers, but flankers against Moira and Lucio is and has been rather ineffective at most ranks anyway. Reaper could use a nerf and Moira needs to be thought out again and reworked. Orisa’s fortify also feels a little strong against dive, but that’s a more personal opinion.",
      "[deleted]",
      "Yeah, no offense to OP but we constantly overestimate our own abilities. Purely anecdotal but I've noticed my tanking making more of a difference when I play because a lot of the enemy tanks just have no idea wtf they're supposed to do or playing a tank as a high hp DPS.",

      "Are the tanks really undesirable or is it cuz the dps got so many more flavors?",
      "Making the game 1 tank role que would be very interesting, but like you say it would require a lot of bugs and probably reworks. Certain tanks would just never be played at the moment since it would be crazy to pick D.va or Zarya to solo tank. Moving to 3 DPS would also make barriers more valuable. You would probably have to nerf barriers in my opinion, so they could still be overpowered by spam/range. It would be a massive swi g in the game balance though, but there is potential there.",
      "Keep in mind that que times vary with SR and region, but I actually generally agree. For most people 20 minute questions are the minority of the time, but it definitely still happens and we definitely remember it when it does. Look at streamers for example who often have really bad que's, partly because of SR.",

      "What rank are you in? Some streamers have been reporting 20+ queue times in GM. A rank like gold has faster queues because at least 25% of the player base is in gold (not sure about the actual number). And no one would lie about long queue times because most people don’t think that long queue times are impressive.",
      "I literally had a 12 minute dps queue in quickplay last night.",
      "My queue times for 1 dps and two healers has been 15 minutes every single match.",
      "My dia q is 3min tank heal and 4min dps",
      "No that was the supports who weren't having fun playing a Walk From Spawn simulator.",
      "No, they weren't. The reason dive doesn't work anymore is the gradual power creep, and the reason people are going vocal about metas getting worse and worse is simply because they are. With Baptiste, you no longer need a defensive ult, as his E is the best defensive tool in Overwatch and it's not even an ult. He also deals far more healing, same with Moira, which more than makes up for giving up on the utility simpler healers like Ana and Mercy brings. So you got so goddamn much healing in the game that the only way to win fights is simply burst damage (which is far from feasible with double shield), or out-sustaining the enemy. Doom is good at burst damage, and he has a ridiculous pickrate this season, which surely isn't a coincidence. This is also present in tanks, which I will get to.\n\nBlizzard doesn't balance game by nerfing the overpowered, but rather buffing the underpowered. A long, long time ago, Rein was a great hero to play. You weren't just an ult battery and a walking target for the red team, you were a present threat that they had to respect. But today? Pretty much any DPS hero can destroy his shield. The damage dealt in this game is increased significantly, so Rein was no longer about providing cover and being an anchor, but rather a fat melee DPS that has to be shielded/sped into action so he can start swinging. Then Orisa became a thing, and unlike Rein she could keep a shield up for much longer, while not being completely helpless. Eventually Orisa found her way into being meta, along with Hog, because running Rein was no longer effective and his kit was now outdated in this game that has a much easier time killing barriers and chewing through armor.\n\nWith all the debate about main tanks and off-tanks, Sigma came. Sigma does literally everything any other off-tank does, but ten times better. It didn't exactly help that, at this point, literally every single off-tank has been bombarded with nerfs in an attempt to stop GOATS. Off-tanks are no longer effective at tanking, while Sigma was designed to be the perfect off-tank. So people gave up trying to play those ult batteries, and run double shield instead. Not even Orisa can compete with the ridiculous damage your shield can take, so it was inevitable that any new shield tank would end up being ran as an off-tank.\n\nAnd now, we're far too beyond the point where things could be salvaged. A complete rework of every single hero in the game is not only a good idea, but a mandatory one. There's a reason people are willing to completely give up on having any sort of fun and run double shield. Because fun loses you games in today's Overwatch. It's all about having more shields, more healing, more spam damage, more kills without even seeing the guy you're killing. You don't have to worry about your accuracy, or your positioning, or your game sense anymore. It's just holding down left click for 10 minutes until something dies so you can finally make a play. \n\n...but yes, I suppose \"haha people are crying about anything\" is also an interesting opinion as well.",

      "The problem is that Sigma counters this. When you dive through ori or rein shield 2 things happen. The rein is forced to move since his shield is bound to him or ori has to have the cd ready to pop the shield inside her team. Compare it to a dva bomb, if you throw it the moment ori deploys she is screwed, if you throw it over rein he is screwed. Sigma just recalls instantly and shoves it to the one you just tried to dive. If that person does not lack any shield-dance you have a problem if you are not bladegenji or df or reaper, winston is just not at a point he is allowed to do that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou coordinate a dive and the Sigma operates solo.

Orihardt is a good hero.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it does not work in prolevel you can assume it only works at another elo because they played bad against it.

If he was nerfed or if armor did fuck all against his shot guns again then rein/zarya and Winston/d.va would be a valid tank combo AS WELL as orisa hog/sigma zarya. The problem is that rein and Winston get 3-4 shot by reaper(if he hits bodies and not head shots) at full health. That’s like one second or two seconds, and he’s getting healed in insane amounts while he’s at it, and even if you stun him he vape walks away to safety. It’s ridiculous, he needs to be reverted to the way he was before all of the buffs he got to counter goats.",

Every single game defines in a different way what a meta is because the meta is the way the game is played at that moment but every game is played in a different way to be different.\n\nDo ppl really think Blizzard suddenly invented the problems they create in OW? BLC and WOTLK pvp pretty much showed what Blizz thinks of competitive integrity. That was a decade ago.\n\nThe problem is not that they are making bad decisions per se. The problem is the approach to competitive esports. Let them make overwatch pve but i'd advice them to save themselves some stress and leave the pvp games to the experts.\n\nEsports? They fuckin lack the respect to run a \"sport\". Did you know they cutted the funding of teams who dont place top10 in the worldcup, a cup they now run in anaheim. They make money out of you but you have to pay the flight? Gotta be kiddin me.\n\nEspecially this part of the video sounds awful familiar doesn't it?

I mentioned doomfist and reaper as being able to ignore it.\n\nAnd sym is strong because she counters shield, how does a character with no mobility except the tp(which is heavily telegraphed) and low range ignore a shield in their face? Overcome is not ignoring. If both teams play doubleshield the team with the sym wins, that doesn't mean she can compensate for having one shield less than the enemy. Otherwise we would have somekind of proper RPS and ppl instalock sym against doubleshield every time while running dva? zarya? You see the problem?\n\n>they will just “replace their shields”\n\nNot they, he. He, sigma, will replace it and when someone thinks that's the time to switch onto him he has shift and throws a knockback stun or he grows some wings just in case.\n\nI know it's stupid and unbelievable but both teams just run sigma, he cannot soloshield but he eats the other offtanks. The dive you need against him is so hard it shoves zen and ana out of the meta, he even counters those 2 by himself and even if you dive so hard past him, you still run the sigma on your team too because why lose that potential? I mean what stops him from pushing that shield into their backline while his diver is in there.\n\nIt's actually hilarious to witness. 4 tanks just stand there and nobody focuses them because they are not oneshot while 2 doomfists decide who can faceroll the enemy backline faster. You already try as much as possible to ignore that shield, ppl are not stupid. Not enough heroes are actually capable of it, that's the problem.",
      "Oh I read it entirely, I just didn’t bother responding to the rest since it was correct for many situations.\n\nAnyway, it’s extremely important to remember that no defending team outside of pro play is going to defend as well as a pro team is. That’s why the idea that double shield is op and requires mirroring is flawed. It’s only really true in pro play, most players are not pros so rushing them down works perfectly fine in other ranks.",
      "How do i put that nicely. Some ppl are not pros but scrim and actually know how to play the game. Only because the amount of ppl who do that is very low compared to for example League doesn't mean they don't count. Everything is a little bit sloppy but the level of coordination is juuust enough to hit the meta wall Blizzard once again forgot to remove after releasing a new hero overtuned.\n\nThe only reason the outcry is not 10times bigger is because ow comp is so derp nearly everything goes but even those notice it.\n\nThere's an old saying in League: \"In soloq everything is viable\"",
      "To quote you, “how do I put that nicely”: not everyone scrims either. The vast majority of players are going to solo q.  The vast majority of players do not scrim actively. The vast majority of players are not pros. If people are complaining about double shield then it makes the most sense to offer solutions that would work for the most people. Stop trying to make this about something it’s not, the pros and people who scrim do not matter in this."

Unless you're assigning people to work them when the city's raw food reserves are full, the workers don't actually spend any time in the hut/hangar.\n\nI think just about every building in Frostpunk does display what it's head level is, but that's not neccessarily a sign it actually needs to be heated. The most notable example is the Snow Pit, which should actually be kept *cold* (it stops working if it gets too warm).",

In any case I have really enjoyed listening to it as I play Troy and it provides a lot of depth, background and context to the game.",

Obviously I'm no Cape, and Im not going to start raiding banks for the experience of it, but do you know of any good games that satisfy the competitive, tactical itch? \n\nSo far my favorite is probably Overwatch. I love the hero themes and how the unique character sets encourage/reward teamwork, planning, and environmental awareness. Xcom 2 has also been great for this, and I have seen the ideas to make an xcom style game in the wormiverse (which I would play the hell out of, naturally) and the ideas to try and make a worm themed game using *Dream* on Ps4 when it comes out. I also read Uncivilized-arrow-launcher's ideas for a worm game, which also sounds fantastic. \n\nSuggestions?",

      "The Dishonored games have pretty cool powers and good variety of ways to play. The 2nd game in particular expanded on a lot of mechanics. Single-player so not really a lot of teamwork, but you can plan out your play-style and how you want to approach different obstacles. I'd heavily recommend playing through each game ~3 times (1st try, low chaos, high chaos) to better understand the different ways to play but understandably not everybody enjoys the franchise as much as I do. I feel like most people only ever play the game once (typically non-lethal stealth) and you really miss out on how much more the games have to offer.\n\nThe standalone DLC-thingy Death of the Outsider even had a mission where you get to rob a bank!",
      "Tricky, seeing as what you describe is best achieved in high-level pvp, and high-level pvp players do their best to win without employing much in the way of tactics when they can get away with it. Dota2 may be your best bet, but Overwatch is probably better.\n\nTrillion: God of Destruction is a 1vEndbringer game, otherwise doesn't fit your criteria though.\n\nThe first Dark Souls can fit that bill depending on your playstyle; it involves drawing enemies into specific positions so you can quickly take them out in sequence, and finding cheeky solutions in the game mechanics.\n\nTransistor lets you customize some bullshit power synergies and plan out ridiculous combos, but 90% of enemies are glorified punching bags as a result.\n\nEndless Legend is a 4x with heroes and rpg elements; diplomacy kinda resembles Worm, and the combat is Xcom-style, revolving around ability synergies (as long as its not a onesided stomp... poor bots)\n\nEdit: EL is actually free on steam this weekend",
      "Try the new Shadowrun games (Dragonfall and Hong Kong, Returns is considered bland). \n\nIt's got a few parallels with Worm. Just with fantasy flavoured cyberpunk instead of somewhat punk-ish superhero stuff.\n\n\\- Dark urban setting with lots of different factions criminal or otherwise and lots of cool colour and texture to it (more than Worm honestly).\n\n\\- A main cast of morally ambiguous but eminently likeable characters with complicated shit you have to help them work out.\n\n\\- A plot involving a lot of conspiracy and intrigue and dangerous threats operating in the background.\n\n\\- And plenty, *plenty* of fucked up shit emergent from the fantastical aspects of the setting.\n\nOn a gameplay level it's a tactical RPG not unlike X-com where the most important aspect of a fight is movement and positioning and there's a lot of challenge and tactics to it. But with a ton of variety in powers and abilities you can use and a pretty robust number of uses for skills to solve problems outside of combat.",
      "It might not be the best match in terms of satisfying the specific tactical itch you get with Worm but Darkest Dungeon has a enough thematic overlaps with the world of parahumans that I've actually considered making a dedicated parahumans: Worm Mod for it on multiple occasions.\n\nIts a turn-based dungeon-crawler with similar risk/reward mechanics to Xcom, make the wrong call or fail to equip your party correctly and people will go insane/die pretty quickly. The individual partymembers also have a lot of individuality and personality to them, none of the classes feel the same even if mechanically they behave fairly similarly.",
      "Probably not what you're looking for in terms of tactics, but Warframe is a MMO third person shooter with over 30 available characters to gather, each with its own unique flashy mechanics. Many are pretty straightforward (shoot lightning, be invulnerable, be good at sword fighting), but some are rather unique and give me a slightly Wormy feel (such as Limbo's ability to shift enemies into the Rift-plane, effectively isolating them and enabling divide-and-conquer tactics, or Chroma, who gains different elemental powers based on his appearance which is normally only cosmetic). Fair warning - the game involves a lot of grinding and has fully consumed me for the past week.",
      "While not the exact gaming genre you listed, Wizard of Legend scratched my Parahumans itch. In terms of power combinations, synergy, and min-maxing stats, WoL has a pretty awesome variety of abilities and buffs. It's a rogue-lite dungeon crawl where you start with 4 selected spells (Melee, Dash, Basic, and Signature) that correspond with the 4 elements but you can gain more each run. Whenever I play I like to imagine that it's superpowers instead of magic and build up the \"Hero's\" powerset. Watching people online combine items that reduce cooldowns with abilities that use projectiles to create machine gun like effects seemed very \"wormy\" to me. Enemies start off as generic mobs, but in the later stages gain abilities such as cloaking, teleportation, AOE effects, and one hit shield similar to Glory Girl. It is lacking in story, but makes up for it in powers and experimentation.",
      "They're not competitive, but it's hard to beat roguelikes for open-ended, tactical combat. If you've never played one, know that what they lack in graphics they make up for in complexity. I think that the most Worm-like example I've played is Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead, but others may have better suggestions.",
      "[Freedom Force](https://store.steampowered.com/app/8880/Freedom_Force/) - it's much more \"four-color comics\" in its themes than Worm, but no other turn-based strategy take on comic-book-superheroes has yet been as good.\n\nIn theory, it's moddable and someone could create the Worm characters for it, but that'd be a lot of effort for little reward IMO.",
      "Not a video game per se, but there is an RPG for Worm called Weaverdice, and there are several discord servers that run drop in drop out games of it. You can roll up a literal worm cape character and have GM's run you fights and the like. ",
      "Possibly just personal preference, but I love Heroes of the Storm, even moreso than Overwatch. The micro is intense, and the outplay potential is huge. It's not as aim/reaction dependent as OW, and there's more macro strategy as well, especially in the draft modes. Easily my favorite video game since City of Heroes shut down. The only real issues with the game are that it takes a while to get enough gold to buy most heroes and the (frankly terrible) report system.\n\nBattlerite is also pretty fun, more of a pure micro sort of game. It's like a MOBA with all the macro stripped away, the only thing remaining is a constant teamfight.",
      "Prototype is probably the best superpower sim and the main character has powers you could stat in Worm better than most",
      "I would recommend \"Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines\"  it's not exactly what you're looking for but the game has similar themes and a wide variety of vampire abilities, this combined with the several different ways of completing a single quest make it great for role-playing a specific character, not to mention that you have to be careful when using your abilities or feeding on people so you don't reveal your identity or the fact that vampires exist, do this too much and it's a game over. \n\nThe game also has several factions all vying for power like the Camarilla which want all vampires to answer to them and are dedicated to maintaining order and keeping vampires a secret, the Anarchs which value individualism and freedom and don't want to answer to the Camarilla but are willing to work together in case of emergencies, the Sabbat which are unorganized and mindlessly kill people with no concern for the masquerade and finally the Kuei-Jin, Asian vampires who are vastly different to the European and american counterparts. Also the end of the world might be imminent and there might be some supremely powerful beings controlling everything from the shadows and the vampires can't really do anything about it.\n\nIt's available on steam and if you do choose to get it make sure to install the unofficial patch as the game is old and not optimized for newer computers with higher resolutions, the patch also fixes several bugs and adds in some of the cut content back to the game, its almost necessary and easy to install.",
      "Bioshock 1 had a major reveal past the halfway point that takes a world and premise you already believe and suddenly makes it *much* more coherent, much like the entities reveal. Very atmospheric, sheds light on real world issues.",
      "I recently played Divinity: Original Sin 2, and it often made me consider how it would be a great framework for a Worm adaptation. It's an open-world CRPG, but it does combat via a turn-based tactics system very similar to XCOM. There are a ton of very interesting magic powers you can get that feel very Worm-esque, including one that switches the positions of two targets like Trickster, and one that makes a suffocating darkness cloud like Grue. Finding synergies and developing strategies around all of these powers felt very reminiscent of Worm.",
      "Dishonoured is a really great choice, Corvo's story is basically a cape waging a one-man war against a mundane human government.\n\nAlso Corvo's power-set definitely fits for a multi-trigger.",
      "I wish there were more games in the dishonored style. It would work great for worm. You would get a power at the start, based on some decisions you make and then as you go through the game you increase in power based on how well your actions match up with what your shard wants you to do.",
      "Dota 2 is probably the go-to moba if you're looking for complexity, and creative options (by that I mean each hero has a range of viable builds instead of two or three \"meta\" strats). \n\nJust be aware of the hellish learning curve and tendency to suck up your life. Also it doesn't resemble Worm at all on the superficial level",
      "If you ever do end up making a mod for it, either reskinning characters or making custom classes for them, please do message me about it.\n\nI already have the image in my head that Taylor would straight up make the party unable to be surprised and have a bunch of blight + multiple target attacks debuff attacks.\n\nLung as a tank with self heals and stacking self buffs.\n\nPanacea gets large single target heals and possibly debuffs+stuns.\n\nGlory girl as a damage dealer that would block the first hit after her turn.\n\nI guess the ones who spawn projections, aka crusader, genesis etc would either create a sort of new party member just for the fight or do the same as the acolyte class mod does.

      "I'm planning on making unique classes based off each of the classifications (eg The Stranger gets combat bonuses because they can use their power to ambush people), but I'd need to look into modding and actually do some dedicated game-design oriented research into Darkest Dungeon before I commit to anything else.\n\nHere's some of my ideas so far:\n\nThe Stranger: Has a Nice Guy-esc \"I'm not a threat\" aura that lets her ambush and avoid attention, also has a minor striker power that lets her light her fire-axe on-fire as a reference to We've Got Worm.\n\nThe Striker: Can play around with mass, weight and impact, wears a set of armour that they've messed with and can debuff foes by messing with their weight/mass/impact.\n\nThe Brute: Has a force-field projection that 'doubles up' over-them, augmenting their strikes and defending them from harm, can use the force-field to attack but it leaves them defenceless.\n\nThe Trooper: A mundane-ass PRT trooper with all the training and gear that entails. Isn't a front-line combatant by any means but is more resistant to stress-effects due to not having a conflict drive like parahumans.\n\nThe Alexandria: Alexandria-Package, very strong and hits hard but likely will have some-kind of stress mechanic to how they function ala the abomination so either the entire party gets stressed out when they act or they get stressed out by maintaining full effectiveness.\n\n\nSkitter could actually be an interesting level-boss or mid-boss. She constantly sets up fights to get the drop on your party, sending minions and swarm-clones that always ambush, forcing you design your party to be effective at any configuration. In her final fight she could have a move where she 'clones' herself with swarm copies so you can't tell where she is and then towards the end uses it to set up a deadly ambush attack by hiding herself lining up a shot as the clone bullrushes a target. Lung would also make a good boss fight because you cannot draw out the fight at all, requiring some very careful planning of team composition to take him out as quickly as possible.",
      "Ah yes, I read that one recently. Quite a good fanfic although the hiatus combined with an earlier ''look into the future'' chapter does make me rather sad.\n\nAlso the halloween omake was glorious, Taylor as the Outsider scaring the shit out of the wards.",

    "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Countryroadbar_FO76/comments/8r4x95/country_road_bar_as_an_organization_rather_then_a/",
    "selftext": "In the long 17 hours since /u/Greeric posted his idea to open a bar by the riverside in FO76, the idea has caught on like wildfire through the fallout community, with a super active discord, this subreddit, and a ton of interest both from patrons and people who want to participate. \n\nNow while I personally have no plans to take on a role within the Country road bar, I am interested in patronizing it, and seeing the idea grow within the Fallout 76 community. \n\nIt has already been established that FO76 will allow somewhere between 24-32 players per server at a time, with parties of up to 4 people (although this has been said to be flexible) the point is, not everyone will be able to attend or participate the primary, original country road bar. \n\nNaturally, the solution to this is to create more then one country road bar, across all platforms and many servers. But I don't just want anyone to be blue to start a country road bar, I want that guarantee of friendliness, of country road hospitality and quality mud crab cakes. Sure, Anyone could just start a bar, and anyone could call it a country road bar, but I want it to be the real deal. \n\nSo my proposed solution, is a more rigorous organization of the Country Road Bar. Already there is a role system,  what if the heads of the country road bar made a \"licensing\" system through the discord? \n\nHere is the gist of it. When, through the discord, a u/Greeric or one of his mods feel that a user has earned their trust and will uphold the standards of the Country Road Bar (this can be done however they feel, to whatever degree they think is appropriate, they could for example need to pay a \"franchising fee\" in game through something valuable like a set of power armor or launch codes. Not so much for the income but to prove how much they value their \"license\") on the discord they can be promoted to the title of a bar owner (or whatever name) and be given a specific tag line for their bar (like how the original will have subtext reading \"take me home\") so we can tell not only that the bar we see is a country bar, but WHICH country bar it is, and this is important. \n\nNow, whenever a licensed bar owner opens his bar of business (while they are online) they could post in a chat room in the Country Road bar discord that only bar owners can post in, and everyone else can read. They would post that their bar is open, the name, the location, and the server is if possible, as well as any other helpful identifying information, and when they log off they post a message saying that it is closed. \n\nThis way, when I, a weary traveler through the West Virginia Wilderness, stumble upon a building with a bright neon \"country road bar\", unsure of whether it is a trap or the real deal, I quickly whip open my discord, go to the appropriate chat room, and see if there is an open bar that fits the description. \n\nAdded bonus, it works as free advertising for the bar owners so they can get trusted clientel to find them. \n\nThe flip side of this system, is a passive enforcement by all the members of the community. Whenever we see a bar that  illegitimately uses the Country Road Bar name, we can warn the owner to change it or get licensed before taking action, but my biggest concern is people using the Country Road Bar name to set traps, or other things that might ruin the community trust in it as a place to safely meet. \n\nI also propose a discord chat room that can be used for SOS situations for bar owners, and a \"most wanted\" page where other bar owners can post the names of people who attacked their bar in the past and ought to be killed/warned by the community or bar owners should watch out for. \n\nTL;DR: I suggest organizing the Country Road bar as an organization in such a way that many bars can be opened by trusted individuals and the integrity of the system can be protected, which should be doable through very simple discord tools.

    "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellaris/comments/9j3mg6/rather_then_purchasing_research_how_about_a/",
    "selftext": "I came up to this while replying to another thread on the topic of buying techs, which while it seems everyone likes the idea of giving empires a way to profit off of research, and giving trade/large empires an alternative research system, it seems that most systems involving the outright purchase of a tech are too difficult to balance and too easy to abuse. \n\nSo my alternative proposal is you provide a research \"licensing\" system.\n\n Basically, you trade for the ability to use a tech for a certain amount of time, which gives you access to the benefits of that tech, as well as a 25% bonus (stackable with research agreements or protectorate benefits) to research on that tech if you research it while you have the liscence. Any ships/buildings built while the tech is liscenced are kept after the agreement expires, but any ship plans that include unliscenced tech are no longer buildable.\n The trade agreement would have a certain minimum cost that neither side gets to keep (call it a logistical cost) that would be proportionate to the trade agreement length and the research value of the tech licensed in order to keep this from being too unbalanced in multiplayer. You would not be able to license a tech unless you have all the requirement technologies either already researched, or liscenced.\n\nThe idea here is to still give research focused empires a way to further profit from their research, at the potential cost of slightly losing their research advantage. It would allow other empires to rent tech ahead of their time, but not allow them to entirely circumvent the research system. The cost of using a technology more then one level ahead of your current tech level would get exponentially more expensive, and would incentivize empires to still invest in research as it would be more efficient on the long term.\n\nThis would also be a more interesting way to do the research mechanic with trade enclaves, where rather then just purchasing a 10% research boost, you choose which techs to temporarily liscence. \n\n\nSo to give an example, of now this might play out in the game, \n\n>!you are a medium trade empire who relies on allies and a federation for protection, but right now there are political tensions within the federation that could lead to a weakened military position that you suspect a rival empire may attempt to take advantage of. You possess the system with the Galactic market, it is a key asset to your trade oriented strategy. \n\nYou, knowing this, have built the strongest defensive spaceport you can in the neighboring choke point system, but you worry it won't be enough, you want to upgrade to a citadel. The problem is, the technology is rare and you don't have that much invested in tech. You know one of your good allies does have the tech, because their empire is fortified by citadels. You have all the other prerequisite tech, and do not need to worry about liscencing other pre-reqs.\n\nSo you offer to liscence the tech for 1 year at an exorbitant cost, you can afford it since it their is one thing you have it is energy credits. You pay the minimum fee for one year and a rare high level tech, which is 4000 energy credits, plus the additional costs to liscence the tech from the other empire, which you negotiate down to a cool 9000 energy credits.  The other empire will still be able to use the tech while it is liscenced.\n\nDuring that year, you are able to upgrade the spaceport to a citadel, and since liscenced tech is also a guaranteed research option just like other partially researched tech, you decide to start researching the technology while you have the 25% tech boost for that technology, even though your research sucks and you won't complete the technology for another 9 years. \n\nYou don't manage to complete the citadel before the tech expires, but because it was already under construction you are still able to complete it. (This could be changed for balance reasons) You now have a citadel, about 15% of the research toward obtaining the tech yourself, and 13000 energy credits fewer.\n\nEveryone leaves happy. You got a citadel, your ally made 9,000 energy credits for their research efforts, and your rivals aren't too upset since it cost you money that would have been built on ships, so they are less afraid of being    attacked!<\n",

    "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/southpark/comments/7jtrdp/what_was_the_point_of_the_pc_principal_and_strong/",
    "selftext": "\n\nHey there Everyone! \n\n\nSo in the recent episode of \"Splatty Tomato\" a lot of people seem confused as to what the point that Matt and Trey were getting at with the relationship between PC Principal, and Strong Woman, and I think I have a really good interpretation for you. \n\nThe episode as a whole was about victimhood, it was constantly directly and subtly hinted, at, but almost every point in the episode ties into it. You have the Whites family, the father of which is constantly talking about how everyone is taking everything from the whites, nobody asked the Whites, the school is responsible for his political problems becaise they are brainwashing the kids, they constantly think of theselves as victims. As was a major theme throughout this episode and season, the Whites, who are anything but the victims, are trying to be the victims to justify their circumstance and decisions. In the early episode, this is immediately contrasted, when the Whites go to visit the Principal and Vice Principal, who's response is \"Uhh, we kinda have bigger problems right now\" The whites in this scene are trying to be victims, wheras PC Principal and Strong Woman, are the actual victims in this episode. \n\nPC principal and Strong Woman aren't representative of the current of the cultural moment because they aren't supposed to be. If anything Matt and Trey accidentally hit a little too close to the cultural momemt, just enough for people to misread it as being affiliated with the current events of abuse, when it is not. PC principal and Strong Woman's relationship is supposed to be something we look at and say \"so what? I don't care who somebody else loves...\" while the society of South Park clearly has a social prejudice toward work place relationships. Sound familiar? It is supposed to be the equivalent of societal homophobia, put in a context that nobody in the real world would actually be predjudiced against. It is ridiculous to care about people loving their coworkers, just as it is ridiculous to care about people falling in love with the same sex. The reactions the people of South Park have to finding Strong Woman and PC Principal are similar to those pf the 1950s against homosexuals sunstitute \"You want to put your penis in...a coworker....\" with \"You want to put your penis in.... another man....\" and you can see the point they were trying to make. \n\nThe purpose of PC principle and Strong Woman's hapless relationship is to contrast all of the people on the show (and in reality) who WANT to be victims of society, and go out of their way to demonstrate how opressed they are, with two people who are actually being societally opressed, actually can't help it, and want anything but attention on their victimhood. The episode was all about how victims actually act, and how people who want to be victims act. Self responsibility, etc. and tolerance. Our society currently heavily emphasises certain brands of tolerance, while beimg completely ignorant to the ones we haven't been exposed to. And PC pricipal and Strong Woman's hapless marriage has nothing to do with our current society, other then to serve as something we can say \"well thay is a ridoculius thing to care about\" and wonder what things we ourselves are as stupid as the people of South Park about. \n\nSorry this got so long!  Let me know your thoughts on this interpretation.\n\nEdit:\nSorry, but just something else to add. The point of showing actual victims in their show, is to respond to criticism against this season. Throughout the season, Matt and Trey have been saying \"Stop trying to be a victim, you aren't a victim\" and people respond saying \"Well according to you there are no vicrims of our society.\" And this relationship is Matt and Trey saying \"No, there are, and tbis is how they look an act,\" using an example we can go and look at and automatucally say, wow thats dumb, those people are victims of their society. And I think it kinda says something that most people who watched the show couldn't recognize PC principal and Strong Woman as the opressed victims. The people of South park don't see their relationship as one person taking advantage of another, they see it as inherently wrong. Like it is both of their faults and they are both doing something wrong.\n\nThis is Matt and Trey showing us victims, and how even durimg a crusade for social justice society is ignorant of the real opressed victims, and being PC, or \"openminded\" doesn't make you immune from that ignorance. ",

      "\nSpoiler: according to BH and KJA, Jessica’s mother was supposed to be the RevMo, Gaius Helen Mohiam. In fact, the prequels describe how he she poisons the Baron for raping her, and it’s why he’s such a bloated and disgusting pusbag by the time of events of Dune. In fact, Dr Yueh is the one who actually informs the Baron that his disease was a BG defense, transmitted to him as a result of Mohiam being defiled by him.",
      "So I just came across this passage on my 5th reading of the book, and I think it is a hint. Here is my hypothesis:\n\nWe know that Jessica is the daughter of the Baron, but we don't know who her mother is, only that they were Bene Geserit. As demonstrated by Lady Fenring and Feyd Rautha, the BG have many methods of getting access to the royal lines, but it is specifically insinuated that Wanna was in a pleasure house.... what if the placement of her there was no accident, but instead she was on a specific Bene Geserit mission to get a female Harkonnen for the BG breeding program? \n\nTo be clear, what if Wanna Marcus, was Jessica's mother? There is another piece of supporting evidence, also placed within the novel. In the intro to Chapter 5, the birth year and death year of Wanna are listed: (Stdrd 10092-10186?) The question mark representing thr uncertainty around her death. \n\nJessica's birth year is listed in the Appendix: (10154-10256)\n\nThis would make Wanna 62 years old when Jessica was born. Old to be bearing a child for certain, but we have to take into account the geriatric effects of the Spice, and the conditioning of the Bene Geserit.\n\nThe final piece of evidence, is how in the chapter with the passage I cross-posted above, Yueh keeps comparing Jessica to Wanna, thinking how similar they are.\n\nIt is hardly conclusive, and there is more than enough reason to doubt, but I think it is still a very distinct possibility. \n\nImagine the irony if Yueh, in his efforts to avenge Wanna, was actually risking destroying her own child.",
      "Are you looking to (re-)discuss the same topic? What is the intention here?",
      "u/Tough-Caregiver-9092",
      "Yeah, the BG wouldn't have any plans of having Yueh betray the Atreides.  That runs 100% counter to their breeding plan.  And yeah, I'm sure Wanna was not being influenced by anyone.\n\nStory-wise, Wanna serves a purpose.  Frank put her in there for a very specific reason.  He needed something powerful enough to break Yueh's conditioning.  The BG can forge bonds of affinity strong enough to do that.  The Baron knew it, and used a powerful thing to break another powerful thing.  It's important to the story.\n\nBut in-universe?  I don't know of any clues.  The BG don't pair off with males or breed casually.  They plan everything.  Like the BG mated pair that produced Miles Teg.\n\nI can't honestly think of a reason why a BG would pair off with a male somewhere and not produce children.  There would have to be a chess-move smart reason for it.  Since that's all they do.  But I can't guess what it is.  There are no hints in the work that I'm aware of.",
      "Then they’re contradicting FH from Children of Dune where it’s mentioned that the “Breeding Records” of the BG show “Jessica out of Tanidia Nerus by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen”.",
      "You have certainly painted a picture. I think it’s about 90% your imagination with little to no real\nevidence in the book but inventive nonetheless.",
      "Yes. I wasn't able to comment on the previous post since it was archived.",
      "Hi, I am not that familiar with reddit: are you asking me my thoughts on the matter of Wanna being Jessica’s mother? \nIf so, it’s an interesting hypothesis, there are passages that could seem to hint to that. However, if that were the case, when Jessica became a reverend mother she would definable learn of her mother being the wife of Yueh. If so, I would say that this piece of the puzzle should definitely have some impact on her. Instead we get nothing. So, from my point of view, interesting idea but very unlikely to be right",
      "Margot paired with Count Hasimir Fenring for purposes other than to have children with him.\n\nWanna could have been bred with someone else before she married Wellington. It's also possible that it was decided not to breed Wanna. Not every BG is bred. The BG keep careful records in their mating index. She may have been flawed in some way.",
      "An excellent notion.  She may have been genetically flawed in some way to make her offspring somehow not viable, and they were using her in a manner similar to Margot Fenring.  Bravo."

      "Its not you, the whole missile system is janky and broken.\n\nI really wish they would rework the janky missile lock system. I just dont like anything about it. I get that they want to balance the amount of time to lock the various sizes but uhhhg. its so clunky and the lock ranges are so short. A ship flying towards you can generally get to you faster than you can lock and launch on them.\n\nIf you can get any of the rings to come in then you've locked them up and you just have to wait for the system to finish locking and give you the audible. This can take 7ish seconds depending on the missile/torpedo size. You have to keep them centered up on your hud as well (well not the visual hud but the actual hidden misaligned hud!)\n\nHopefully the HUD rework will fix a lot of this and I think they also have a missile system rework scheduled as well.",
      "As a freelancer mis owner, yup the missile game system sucks",
      "Theres two issues at play here, First is the server inconsistency as you've pointed out,   \nIt seems the tickrate makes the position of the enemy ship jump in and out of range if they're somewhere on the edge of your missile lock range\n\nEach missile has their own range they can be locked at, Larger size missiles lock further out  \n\n\nAnd the second issue is ship specific, the 325a has two missile racks on it's wings, with the missiles pointing forward, And a custom missile rack on it's belly, intergrated into the hull. Pointing at a roughly 30 degree angle downwards from the nose of the spaceship, The combination of that, And the inability to choose which missile to lock with your input, Makes it unreliable, As you can never know which missile the game is going to attempt to lock on target when you hit the key.  \n\n\nA temporary, Imperfect, very un-compettive solution would be to attempt to lock your missiles pitching  30 degrees up from target, Where you can see their targeting UI roughly over your radar. That will allow you to lock the belly missiles  \n\n\nSometimes missile system fails entirely, and a powercycle helps it to function again",
      "I've found in both a Retaliator and a Sentinel that the missile lock system is unreliable but I have not needed to power cycle the ship.\n\nFrom recent combat experience I've noticed that my vector to target seems to impact my ability to achieve a lock.\n\nIf our vectors are not aligned in some specific way I cannot get a lock. If I strafe my target and find a different attack vector suddenly a lock will register.\n\nThis appears to hold true after a lock is achieved. If my target jukes me and ends up outside of my weapons reticle the lock will fade, as we normally expect. When I reacquire my target in my reticle usually the missile lock will automatically relock. As with previous observations though, depending on my attack vector the relock is not automatic. I might spend another 30 seconds strafing my target with the target solidly in my weapons reticle before the missile lock automatically reacquires. \n\nOnce I am ready to fire I've noticed I have to hold my missile fire keybind for several seconds before a missile will fire.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone else experience similar quirks? Or perhaps I am imagining that attack vectors are related to this issue.",

    "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellaris/comments/7go6qe/in_regard_to_the_new_doomstack_dev_diary_i_have/",
    "selftext": "I trust the devs to make the right decision here, but please, pretty please, don't make the bonus for having a relatively small fleet in fire rate, make it in evasion/combat speed and accuracy. \n\nMaking the bonus to evasion would open up all kinds of interesting strategies, allow for more specialization, and make small ships like corvettes, make small ships like cruisers and destroyers relevant in the late game without being overpowered, and finally, it just makes more sense from a believability stand point. \n\nLet me explain. An evasion bonus would most heavily boost smaller ships like destroyers and corvettes. This means that you can essentially \"speed tank\" your corvettes, and build specialized small fleets of corvettes/destroyers that are designed to, for example, slow down an enemy fleet when it is on the offensive so you can maneuver your defenses into position/bring in support, or it can be used to help your more powerful fleets pin down a retreating enemy, by using their superior speed to catch enemy fleets, and survive long enough (given their high evasion ability) for you to bring in bigger funs to do serious damage.\n\nThis also lends itself well to the \"rock paper scissors\" strategies of using destroyers and cruisers, since the best eay to counteract high evasion, small fleets is to use \"hunters\" or destroyers specially equiped with weapons like high accuracy weapons and high enough speed abilities themselves so they can easily dispatch an enemy cutter fleet, and free you to move. Spamming corvettes with incredible evasion bonuses won't be a viable stratefy since the enemy can counter such fleets with far more effective destroyers. \n\nIt also prevents larger ships from being too relevant as small fleet ships, you should not get an overall bonus by simply staggering your attacks against the enemy using tiny, one ship fleets. A large ship by itself doesn't get nearly as much of an advantage from lots of space to maneuver as a small ship does. The accuracy bonus should be there, so it isn't a total wash and so that when larger fleets engage where there is still a significant size difference the smaller fleets big ships do get something very useful, but it should prioritize smaller ships. \n\nFinally, it is way more believable of a bonus. I mean a smaller fleet should have an easier time evading enemy fire, getting clear firing opportunities on a larger, bulkier enemy fleet. Larger ships should be built with the intention of destoying heavy enemy instalations, or enemy large ships. This bonus won't make it so a small group of corvettes has any realistic chance of destroying a fleet of battleships, the firepower just isn't there. But they should be able to last significantly longer, do more cost effective damage to the enemy,  etc. In other words, they would have significant strategic value. \n\nI don't like the idea of boosting fire rate or damage or anything like that, for one thing it doesn't make any sense, ships shouldn't be shooting faster because there are fewer ships. For another, it is a huge opportunity to add strateguc depth, missed. I realize that Wiz was just throwing out an example, and it was likely not a representative of what will be in the final release, but I feel that this is a really cool opportunity. \n\nOne thing I have always disliked in stellaris is how in the late game small ships become less and less relevant, building fleets just becomes about building the biggest, baddest ships possible. Sure mods can help and there can be a diversity of big ships, but I want reasons to think about whay class I am building, so i actually value a dedicated corvette fleet, or so on. Just imagine the clever strategies and counterstrategies you could employ with dedicated corvette fleets, siege fleets, corvette hunter fleets. \n\nI otherwise REALLY like the direction Wiz is taking things, the update looks great, it is more then I ever hoped for and I habe huge respect for the devs in really going out of their way to make this game better.

      "Wiz mentioned evasion in some of his responses. If I remember correctly he said that evasion doesn't give a tangible enough bonus to make an actual difference. ",
      "There is a cap on evasion that has to exist for balance reasons (going above 90% evasion would be pretty op) and corvettes are probably going to be close to that already...but I like this idea. My problem with the increased fire rate is once we figure out how it's calculated we'll be able to figure out the softcap for dps, if there is one, and we're stuck with hitting each other with identical fleets.",
      "You are interpreting too much into that bonus. It's only meant to slightly even out the casualties in uneven battles. It's something that just has to work without thinking about it, and it shouldn't have surprising side effects.\n\nSetting up a special fleet to exploit that extra evasion is exactly what they are trying to prevent.\n\nAdditionally it creates situations where you want to be outnumbered and an AI ally joining the fight would screw you over, that's certainly also something they want to prevent.\n\nThat could also be done with an \"independent\" evasion value instead of an additive one, but they would probably have to program that extra logic, while a fire rate buff is just a value that can be added to an already existing system.",
      "So, against an enemy doomstack you just send a single unarmed high-evasion corvette and watch the fleet miss for month on end?",
      "Question about the update - if there are fixed energy limits for each ship type, does that create a disadvantage for shields, because they use energy and armor does not?",
      "Here's the problem with this.\n\nEvasion buffs (even something crazy like 50%) mean jack-all to larger ship classes, meaning your suggestion would only apply to corvettes, and maybe destroyers.\n\nA fire rate improvement applies equally to *any* type of ship.",
      "The main problem I see with this is that it provides dramatically different bonuses for different fleet compositions and designs. The evasion bonus does essentially nothing for high-evasion corvettes (Since they're probably already close to or even at the evasion cap) *or* battleships of any kind (Which go from having basically no evasion to having just a little bit more than basically no evasion). The accuracy bonus does much more for non-XL kinetics than it does for lasers (Especially small lasers), and depending on what changes they make, might not have *any* effect on missiles (Though it does sound like it might for some).\n\nMeanwhile, a +25% fire rate buff is almost entirely consistent and independent of fleet composition or ship design.",
      "It's gamey, but I'm fine with it.  Better to have a mechanic that works predictably, for both devs and players.",
      "Not sure if you got this from the Diary due to the way you wrote this post and some of your responses, but the bonus you get (in whatever form it will eventually come) is based of the *total* strenght of each side - engaging their 90k with your 20k does not buff your 20k if you have 70k waiting in the wings somewhere else\n\nEven so, I do agree that a +fire rate modifier doesn't seem very logical, but it is probably the most balanced&meaningful buff they can give\n\nas to how they will calculate the total strenght, we'll have to wait and see, just like what the final numbers on the buff will end up becoming",
      "Ships being able to evade more because they are a small fleet makes the same amount of sense as them firing faster. The tech of the ships is the same regardless of fleet size. I believe the change is for a more meta aspect of combat than realistic. The combat in this game has hardly ever been realistic anyway.",
      "I still think the solution of wiz works better. \n\nAlso it sounds a bit that evasion instead of fire rate is wanted because of realism reason. I rather prefer the \"unrealistic\" modifier with the better results than anything else which gives a sub par result. \n\nAnd you are always talking about corvette fleets and small ships. I dont think you completly understood why that modifier is needed. Its not about a fleet of some corvettes taking on some battleships. Its about that the larger fleet takes exponentially less damage the larger it gets, resulting in having almost no loses once your fleet is 50-100% bigger than the enemies. Which is totally unrealistic. \n\nThe bigger ships dont get the advantage of evasion. So once you unlock the bigger ships and come into the mid and late game you evasion bonus will be useless again and you would have the same problem again that the bigger force utterly crushes the smaller force with almost no losses. Which is currently the biggest drawback in combat.  \n\nSomething like a corvette fleet seems like a bad choice also. A fleet is supposed to have different ships for different purposes and not just one type in it. \n\nAnd lastly to your complain that corvettes become useless (according to you) in the late game: Naked corvette strat? Its not long ago that this was the best strategy in the game. So please dont pretend that your precious corvettes has been useless for the past 2 years. They have been literally been the best option not long ago...",
      "I believe the issue was an evasion bonus was wildly different for a corvette  vs a BB. Basically evasion bonuses might be good for smaller ships, but larger ships would get basically no bonus at all because they have such low evasion. Fire rate wasn't initially what they wanted, but it was a compromise that was useful regardless of hull size. ",
      "Especially as missiles can't miss.",
      "That is why I included the accuracy bonus as well, which admittedly would mean you would eant to tune your fleet to take advantage of such a bonus (going heavier on torpedos or heavy guns for example) but I think that just adds to the strategy. \n\nIts just that firing rate seems so arbitrary, it doesn't make sense that having a smaller fleet would make you better at shooting quickly. Evading incoming fire, given the extra space and smaller target? Ya. Having a clearer shot to the larger enemy force? Ya. But reloading your guns more quickly? What?",
      "I didn't know corvettes could get that high of an evasion stat in the current iteration, tbh. Ya, I wouldn't want it to be like the old corvette swarm strategy, I just want to make corvettes feel like an qctual addition to my fleet with a distinct purpose. ",
      "> My problem with the increased fire rate is once we figure out how it's calculated we'll be able to figure out the softcap for dps, if there is one, and we're stuck with hitting each other with identical fleets.\n\nI don't think there's going to be a softcap.  Sounds like the fire-rate bonus is going to scale such that you'd always need to remove more fleet power in ships than you'd gain in fire-rate bonus.  After all, the intent is just to make victory costlier during times when it is already assured. \n\nIf there is a softcap then it probably won't be much more than \"a few corvettes under the command cap\" and staying at that cap probably won't get you more than a couple percent fire-rate bonus, except in situations where you are already significantly outnumbered.",
      "Ha love it when one sentence destroys a \"short - story long click bait post\" that Is only looking at the modifiers in one dimension.\n\nSuch a bonus would make the \"endless stream of corvettes to occupy enemy doomstack\" - exploit even MORE powerfull.\n\n> One thing I have always disliked in stellaris is how in the late game small ships become less and less relevant\n\nYou haven't played Stellaris at release did ya?!\n\nAlso as said in the DD smallerships will have an easier time to retreat and survive a battle than bigger ships. Also with Missiles / torpedoes becomeing more powerfull you (likely) end up with more rockets if you have corvettes. (since one corvette can carry one and A Battleship ... I guess max 3?!)\n\nPro Tip: don't look as the bonus as suddenly the smaller fleet fires faster, more like due to less micromanagement, the smaller fleet can fire faster **compared** to the bigger fleet.",
      "Yes, exactly. And if you read the rest of that OP said, it provides a reason to have a couple of separate, small, destroyer fleets on hand to counter that those dozens of single corvette fleets harassing the doom stack.\n\nIn other words, encouraging play style which breaks up the doom stack into multiple fleets.\n\nI think the idea here is fleets act as a coordinated group, all going after the same target. So it would make sense that if an entire navy is coordinating their efforts and fire against a fleet made up of a single corvette, then yeah, that navy is going to get bogged down.",
      "Well if you know how the evasion and accuracy stats work, then you know this wouldn't happen. Even against the biggest and clumsiest ships, they are going to get hits. This boost in the evasion stat would not be like a 90% increase even in the most lopsided of battles, it would have a cap of course. The point of the boost would be to increase the effecriveness to a tangible degree, not to a gamebreaking extent. So using smaller fleets of Corvettes would be relatively effective at slowing your enemy down, but no, it would never be anywhere close to that extreme. ",
      "Though the diary did say that the buff for smaller fleets would be capped at 100% larger fleet. \n\nEvasion just favors corvette spam. We all know what happens with that...",
      "Before 2.0, the strategy is to get to 90% dmg reduction from armor then fill the rest of the slots with shields and reactors. Armor is the main form of defense, shields don't give anywhere near the dps reduction it does. Now, the strategy is probably going to be to put as many shields on as possible after weapons then fill the rest with armor. Shields didn't get nerfed, they are bad and with armor adjusted they will be useful again.",
      "Total for that combat. A fleet in a different system doesn't count.",
      "What? You mean space battles with lasers and kinetic batteries are unrealistic? :o",
      "That was my comment he was answering actually (OverthinkingThis) and this is correct. They tried other metrics as well such as range/accuracy but settled on Fire Rate as the 'always good for everyone' bonus.",
      "But that is my point... ah well. I will trust the devs like I said. ",
      "Missiles can miss with this update, I believe. ",
      "Shoot quicker because you have more targets, so less picking the shot, and just shooting into the mass of enemy ships. ",
      "I think you can get between 70 and 80% evasion right now on corvettes, maybe higher (I don't bother building them). It seems like they're trying to make corvettes \"budget\" ships that are less effective but more likely to survive a battle by disengaging.\n\n\n\nI imagine they would be most useful as commando fleets, rushing past defenses or sneaking in via jump drives, blowing up spaceports, and showing back up at your homeworld after being defeated.",
      "Yeah, the example Wiz gave (all numbers not final, of course) was that if fleet A is twice the size of fleet B, then fleet B gets a 50% ROF increase. In a comment he clarified that it'll probably cap at double fleet size, implying this is the biggest bonus possible. So I doubt it'll be too easy to abuse. \n\nWorth remembering, though, that the bonus is only based on size, so if you out-tech the enemy sufficiently and/or build fleets that effectively counter theirs, this bonus could make it possible to actually win battles even if you have half the fleet size.",
      "And the smaller flees doesn't have to aim as much. When the sky is all targets, who needs to take aim?",
      "So, given your assumptions about my lacking knowledge of game mechanics. Please tell me how you would boost evasion for a corvette that is both high enough to matter but low enough to ensure that corvettes don't become unhittable for anything other that small weapons and arc emitters. And at the same time relevant to other ship sizes as well",
      "have You missed Wiz’s responses? You’ll see why they aren’t going with your idea.",
      "that's not how I interpreted this line from the Diary; \n\n> 'force' being every ship engaged on one side of a battle, regardless of how many fleets and empires are involved on each side\n\nTo me that sounded like they will look at all forces and compare them, not all forces currently engaged in combat (or *per* combat even). Reading it again, I might be wrong...",
      "That actually isnt unrealistic. It is more about how a small swarm of small ships can heavily damage or even defeat a much bigger ship. Realistically they wouldnt be anything more than a pest for a big ship because their weapons would be too small and underpowered to do much at a certain point. Shields would hold, armor too thick, etc. But instead the combat is just straight numbers. Bigger ships get bigger numbers for shields and all that so it just takes a little longer to beat them down instead of them tanking the damage properly.",
      "That's not in the Dev diary. Is it?",
      "Let’s just say there’s a reason why OP isn’t in game design.",
      "To me, the key here is \"*engaged* on one side of a battle\". If you have a fleet in a different system then it's not engaged.\n\nThere's also the idea that the objective here is to prevent doomstacking. If your bonus will depend on the total number of ships you have (as opposed to ships in battle) then you'll always be better off having all ships together anyway, and this might help for balance reasons but wouldn't help the doomstacking problem.",
      "Wait, I'm not sure what you actually said there because you worded it a little convoluted. Are you saying it's unrealistic for small ships to overpower larger ships?\n\nThat was a pirate strategy in the 1800s and was effective.",
      "So they didn't explicitely say so in this dev diary, but I got the impression form this quote in the section about [Missiles and Hull Damage](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/stellaris-dev-diary-96-doomstacks-and-ship-design.1058152/) \"Torpedoes are slow and inaccurate but excellent at punching through armor, while Swarmer Missiles are poor against armor but wreak havoc on hull and (as before) are ideally suited to overwhelming enemy PD.\" So when it said Torpedos are innacurate I got the impression that meant they can miss, but I may have been jumping to conclusions. I'm not sure  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",
      "There is a huge difference between wood ships from 200 years ago and highly advanced metal spaceships.\n\nIt is more like if you took 12 men armed with M4s or even AKs and they all shot at an M1 Abrams. The rounds would just ping off and at best scratch the paint. You would need a much larger gun to pierce through a tank.\n\nThat is how it would be for Corvettes against Cruisers and higher. Atleast the average corvette. You might be able to make a tank buster corvette with just one big main gun. The AI always came at me with just simple auto cannons though, and they would be too small on a corvette to over power shields and pierce armor on cruisers.",
      "Missiles already sucked and now they're limited to torpedo slots and can miss, I guess they really don't want people to use missiles",
      "Yup, reading that I think you're right. I still feel evasion might lead to it being a bit cheesy though.",
      "Though since ships now fight less effectively with damaged hulls and missiles ignore shields and armour, an opening salvo of missiles launched from swarming corvettes could give a significant advantage in any battle."

    "selftext": "If I remember this has been brought up on this sub before, but apparently revamping the crisis and the late game is one of the focuses of the 1.8 update. \n\nWith that in mind, my idea was to make a new late game mini-crisis that involces altering the FTL mechanics. Essentially you get a message saying \"Our scientists are detecting a sunspace anomaly with physics technobable extreme tamifocations!\" And all of the FTL methods are effected in some way that changes the geography of the galaxy indirectly. \n\nFor example, the simplest is the hyperlanes which are suddenly rearranged. For more interesting results, make it so some of the new hyperlanes are randomly very fast to use, and others are very slow. \n\nFor the warp drive, chamge it so that the range of warp is now elyptical, where it is fast in one direction and slow in another. This  one is definitely open to more interesting ideas however, perhaps it could use the same mechanic I am thinking for the wormholes. \n\nFor the wormholes, and possibly the warp drives, where you are in the galaxy has a huge effect on how your FTL drive works. For example, the closer you are to the center of the galaxy the longer the range of your warp drive/wormhole, but also the slower it is to activate. The further you are from the center, the shorter the range of the FTL drive but it activates much more quickly. \n\nThis mechanoc could be carried over to the hyperlanes as well. Perhaps the network is more dense in the center and then more spread out in the outer edges. \n\nThis would have the effect of really shaking up late game conflicts, it would allow for a very defensive style of warfare in the outer reaches where hit and run tactics are now more difficult  since fleets can respond faster and it is more difficukt to get deep into enemy territory, meanwhile in the center of the galaxy the inverse would be true where conflicts would be very offensive with slow response times and deep unexpected inscursions. \n\nIt may be too late to implement this in the next update, but if not this is also a good mod idea so if someone with the knowhow and time gets the opportunity I would support this mod!",

[https://relay.sc/transcript/calling-all-devs-9th-july](https://relay.sc/transcript/calling-all-devs-9th-july)\" **Implementing a more PU-esque battle mode in Arena Commander might be implemented fairly quickly in theory, however some of the issues against it would be a fluctuating number of players, which would slow down flow for the players as they may not be able to find a full match straight away. Balancing would also be very hard to do. CIG are still looking at a dedicated team for Arena Commander and Star Marine but are not ready to announce anything for that yet. The focus is the PU and the player numbers reflect that. It is an idea that CIG like so it is not entirely off the cards but it is not something players will see any time soon.** \"\n\nNobody's playing AC or SM because they SUCK, so of course the player numbers reflect that. If they'd get some love, more people would play it - especially if they merged AC and SM into Combined Arms scenarios.\n\nCR recently said they were planning to do that, but they're \"planning\" a lot of things, so the question is when it'll actually be available. But again, since proper ship fights and FPS are absolutely essential to Squadron 42, I'm hoping we'll see some good shit soon."

That makes producing big armies and maximising harvesters harder but an experienced player will know how to boost their manpower gains but it will detract from their other resources like using more votes in the Landsraad on resolutions that affect manpower or building the extra manpower base upgrade early.

      "The wargame trio of artillery, cavalry, infantry comes to mind.",
      "So this is the core of my system.  It began when I wanted a \"cooler\" version of rock, paper, scissors, which became super strength, super smarts, and telekinesis respectively.  Then these mixed with Star Wars's three categories of Force powers, Plato's three souls, and to a minor extent Peter Carroll's Aeonics (originally it had must more relevance).  Now they're praxics (\"immutable\" enforcers of morality), theorics (hyper-competent scientist sages who see all and know all), and poetics (visionaries who are inherently lucky).  Poetics beat theorics by altering their desires and perceptions, theorics beat praxics by altering their understanding of moral and natural law, and praxics beat theorics by generating shame to kneecap their desires.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want a very good version of a RPS magic system that reflects philosophies, look at John C Wright's *Orphans of Chaos*.  It's my primary inspiration and it has not three but four (and really, six) dueling philosophies which trump one another.  Animism/idealism is beaten by Gnosticism/dualism, which is beaten by Rationalism/materialism, which is beaten by Relativism/monism/agnosticism.  The other two are a mystery that the novel and its sequels explore so I won't get into those.",
      "Maybe something like magic derived from depth of knowledge, magic derived from strength of will, and magic derived from others—like contracting a demon to do the voodoo for you. \n\nKnowledge would know of the demon’s powers, will would circumvent knowledge through faith, and the demons would break/subvert will/faith. \n\nSeparate, advantage on one, disadvantage on the other.",
      "I'm immediately thinking of Sins of a Solar Empire, where you have three factions, which act against one another in two different sets of rock-paper-scissors, and roughly correspond to the WW2 ideology triad:\n\nTrader Emergency Coalition - capitalism: huge economy, but weak units; early game advantage\n\nAdvent - communism: excellent fleet synergy, but takes time to get there; late game advantage\n\nVasari - fascism: some economical advantages offset by costs\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, in military terms, TEC beats Vasari beats Advent beats TEC.",
      "That is a good start, now I just need it more magic-y, and ideally in such a way that makes sense why they would be separate. Maybe I could do something like a \"school of conjuration\" counters a spell group that only can attack one enemy per turn (but with high damage), meanwhile a school of area-of-effect spells like fire or something counters conjuration,  and the single attack high damage also has more range (call it lightning) also has more range then the fire-area-of-effect school and therefore we have our rock paper scissors. It is a bit of a stretch, but a good start.",
      "Could go the opposite way too. Power strong-arms intelligence (jocks and nerds, grants and research), knowledge trumps belief/trust (small town secrets, religious apologetics), and trust/faith beats power (many vs one, tyrants and revolutionaries)\n\nUsing your model and adding ideology, strength of will would be idealists or even solipsists, believing that mind trumps matter and maybe matter doesn't even exist. Magic from others would be the transcendental belief in \"letting the spirit move through you\", allowing powerful spirits to \"ride\" them to access their powers. The knowledge group would be alchemists and other material-based mages who alter the environment and themselves to produce effects.\n\nWill would naturally trump faith because the faithful weakens their mind to allow spirits to control them. Faith would trump knowledge because their powers can reshape matter but aren't bound by it. Knowledge would trump will because will can't see the effects environmental changes have on the psyche."

    "selftext": "In my recent experience with the game, most dogfights are one-sided, with one side drastically outscoring the other. Occasionally this doesn't happen, and the match is quite close, but this is very rare. \n\nMany people seem to believe this is because of the matchmaker, which while like anything it can probably be improved, I don't think this is actually the issue. \n\nIn my opinion, the issue at the moment is that whichever team has a concentration of fighters in an area (their team stays together) will almost always win, and will continue to win. This leads to a snowball effect. If one side gains an advantage in the initial engagement, say the other brings support craft into the dogfight, not knowing how difficult they are to use in dogfight without coordination, that teams initial advantage may be almost insurmountable within the short time frame of a dogfight.\n\nEvidence for this being the problem can be demonstrated in the differences between maps. Maps with lots of terrain and areas to separate players from allies tend to be less lopsided, like the shipyards for example. Maps that are completely open tend to be the most lopsided of all, since they allow teams that are winning to immediately support allied craft.\n\nThe solution on an individual level is to coordinate with your team, wait for your allies to respond before charging in, to avoid being staggered. This of course is REALLY hard to do with casual players in dogfight. In fact, even if you do coordinate it can be difficult to overturn the group advantage, since you have to not only wait for your allies to respond with you, but you also have to regroup with them or coordinate engaging with the enemy team. If you are staggered in your attack at all, this will still give the other team an advantage.\n\nThe potential developer solutions also have some downsides. The simplest would be to make it so players respond in waves. This has the downside of making. It so that if your team starts losing a fight in a certain engagement, the added time until reinforcement makes it more likely for defeat to be total, at least in that wave. It does have the upside though of also making the presently winning side wait longer for reinforcements, making it a little harder to snowball. Of course, this helps with staggered respawns, but does not solve the problem of players being spread out. Another optional solution might be to not only have players respawn in waves, but to have them respawn as a group. This has the downside of making the game considerably more stale, since it might make every engagement like the very first one when both teams spawn.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is this a real problem? What other causes might there be for how one-sided fights tend to be? What solutions might there be?",

      "The only times I feel like the game is one sided is when 2 or 3 people on a team have 0 kills and over 5 deaths, and usually those people are under level 10. I believe that’s it’s just almost impossible to carry people who have such little game sense that they repeatedly run into a group of enemy star fighters without getting a shot off and then run into a rock. These people will eventually get better or quit, but until then we have to deal with them.",
      "I agree. I still feel that rebels shields is a better advantage than TIE maneuverability, but teamwork is a big part of it. I feel that most games I lose are because the other team is clumped together tp pick us off (which can be annoying for them too because I have been on a team like that, and they always steal my kills!) Plus, having an enemy ALWAYS locking onto you sucks. However, I am very new to this game and still need much practice, too. I will say matchmaker does need some clean up. How they do that idk, but I have found that when I play Empire I will be at the top with like 5 kills, and the republic has 3 different people with nearly 10 or more by the end of the match. I don't know if more experienced players purposefully choose to always be republic because of shields for an even greater edge, but it seems that the NR almost always has those couple people who dominate, which I find interesting.",
      "I'm not sure if my observations are consistent with yours.  I've seen close matches on Yavin and slaughters on Nadiri.  The gap between skilled and inexperienced players in this game is vast, and I've always felt the outcome of Dogfights to be largely a function of which team has the greater combined skill.\n\nI like the format as it is.  It keeps the number of players in the battle at any given time relatively constant and minimizes wait time between death and respawn.  Yes, I've seen complaints of teams ganging up on opponents as soon as they spawn, but this hasn't happened often in my experience, and when it does there's always a large skill disparity between sides (so it would have been a slaughter regardless).",
      "Agree that the team that wins the early engagements has an advantage but to me the presence of 1 or 2 aces really turns things into a slaughter. Once the snowball starts, the winning team can just pick off the losers one or two at a time as they respawn. I’ve seen it bad enough where the whole team is dead. You’re killed within seconds of spawning no matter what you do.\n\nThis isn’t even fun for the winning team to be honest, except for the seal clubbers. Kills are so fast, you’re lucky to get an assist.",
      "What I’ve seen to be one of the biggest issues is the respawn... From what I’ve seen is it’s seemingly random where players respawn on the outskirts of the arena spread out from the rest of their squadron. A lone fighter is easy pickings as it tries to re-engage the fighters that hold the midfield. The inability to regroup and engage the midfield all together is a huge part of the problem with the dogfight slaughters we’ve seen. Not to mention that with the midfield, you also have the respawning repair kits. To put it very simply in a way we all understand: the midfield = the high ground",
      "I do feel like matchmaking is strange sometimes, I've had matches where the opposite team had several people over level 50 and we didn't have anyone above 11. \n\n\nI felt the like the game was one-sided sometimes, but I usually felt like that was a skill issue honestly. I've never felt like I'm loosing for any other reason than the opposite team being better than us. Which is a great compliment for a multiplayer game.",
      "A team of 5 Tie Bombers is more or less unstoppable in every phase of fleet battles. That should tell you all you need to know about balance right now.",

      "Let's not",
      "Don’t rush into the middle of their 4v1 advantage. Pick off one to the side or group up with a team mate.",
      "that hasn't been my experience. Some matches are blowouts sure, others are close. Without seeing actual data, it's just guesswork.",
      "All it takes is just 1 Ace in your team to carry. Thats basically it.",
      "I'm glad the play encourages teamwork. It adds to the play. Also if you recognize this happening and happen to be on the losing side, why not change your strategy?? I have turned many a fight simply by switching crafts and loadouts even if it's something I'd rather not play with. Recognize the enemy strategy, respond, and communicate as a team. \n\nSolid stuff.",
      "There is probably truth to this, which would point toward the matchmaking solution, I guess I was just aiming to explore other potential problems/solutions. I agree though generally, I just don't know how realistic it is to expect better matchmaking for dogfights.",
      "I will say Fleet is balanced though. People are complaining about how the Republic flagship is too hard to destroy, but get a team with TIE bombers and interceptors and you can easily win. All it takes is put targeting on flagship subsystems and I recently learned you can go inside the shields. Then just divert powers to weapons and have a good loadout, then you can annihilate it from inside the shields without having to take them down (with the exception of being waayyy vulnerable to turrets, but that's why you go for targeting and power first) I have played all my fleet battles with Empire and won every one so far. The TIE Bomber is pretty OP though, and interceptors are always good for clean kills if the match is tight.",
      "I actually think the Rebel shields are relatively balanced, it just takes some adjustment since the rebel shields are a bit easier for new players. Primarily in that rebel craft are generally better at winning head on jousts, and it takes some practice to learn how to not get into those as a tie fighter.",
      "I don't mean to say it doesn't happen, but in my experience Yavin tends to be one-sided more than any other map except maybe Zavian Abyss for some reason.\n\nI agree in terms of I like the game play of the format. The pacing is great, it feels consistent, I just don't like that the vast majority of my matches seem really one-sided at the moment.",
      "After a few rounds of being the seal it’s quite nice to be the clubber.",
      "Exactly this. I am generally very much on the seal clubbers side of things in most of my matches, and honestly I don't enjoy it nearly so much as a close match, and I feel most of it comes down to matchmaking. I am probably the best pilot on my team 80% of the time and 2nd best the other 15%. My goal isn't really to boast, since I am just among the more active and experienced players, it isn't surprising. It would be much better if I were matched with people of similar rank in which case I should see a more normal distribution of my performance relative to my team.",
      "There are ways to survive when going out of spawn, but most people don't know how to do it and basicly just rush into combat asap like a lamb to the slaughter, very common in pvp games i might add.\n\nAnd yes i do a lot of seal clubbing, honestly pretty much the only time i have a hard match is when there is like 2 aces on the enemy team and i have 3 people in my team with a total of less than 4 kills.\n\nDue how the game is, people who don't know how to play this yet gets easily stomped on.\n\nI think that matching totaly fresh people or people with disabilitys with the aces of the galaxy can be a bit much at times for those poor souls, don't need a creazy hard mmr, but just enought to put people like me who have an 3,66 kd(and rising) against people with 0.15-0.60 kd on a regular base, i don't mind them in my games and i think it can be good for them from time to time to meet someone that is strong, but i meet them all the time, most matches are me just chilling in my interceptor or A-wing and picking them off one by one ending up with 1 or 2 death ( mostly due to my arch-nemesis that damn hacker called pilot error\\*\\*), I don't blame them for leaving those games as getting several lobbys with aces in a row can be disheartening.",
      "Lol very true. I agree. \n\nNew Players seeing the entire enemy team in a swarm in the middle: \"You underestimate my power!\"",
      "I am level 31 and rarely see a match without at least one player under level 5. I feel so bad for them, especially when they unwittingly decide to try a support craft, having no real idea what that is setting them up for.",
      "That might be one solution. Maybe they should just shorten the respawn timer and give each team a consistent spawn location. If one team is winning, they will be further from reinforcements and will probably be pushed back since the other team will have much faster respawns.",
      "More often than not, I am on the team that wins overwhelmingly. I don't mean this as a boast, I just play more than most of the present player base and have a lot of prior experience with flight Sims. It doesn't change the fact that whether you are on the winning team or the losing team, one sided blow outs are not so fun.",
      "I agree that Fleet seems pretty well balanced. Once the MMR issues are fixed I expect to play fleet more than dogfight, but at the moment I play dogfight more.",
      "Yeah that’s very true",
      "What happens 5% of the time?",
      "A consistent spawn location would result in serious spawn camping I think.",
      "Sure, but almost every blow out is due to people trickling back one at a time which is easily preventable.",
      "I am on a team where I am not in the top 2. It has probably happened, but I can't remember a match where I was the worst on my team. I has definitely happened where I was in 3rd though.",
      "That is definitely a potential concern. I was thinking more like a side of the map though than a single spawn location maybe.",

      "325a is a faster, sleeker version of the Avenger Titan, something I call \"Transitional Fighters\". That is, they possess utilities and sizes that are not very fighter-like, but they have fighter-sized weaponry and can operate similarly to other fighters. They tend to hit like Medium Fighters (Sabres, Hornets) but be armored along the lines of Light Fighters (Gladius, Arrow) with the catch that they don't fly like Light Fighters at all. In short, they're good for general purposes, daily drivers, and can defend themselves when attacked, but they are not dedicated fighters and those weaknesses are obvious the second an engagement commences.\n\nThe Arrow's nimble and accurate with its remote turret and gimbal placements, allowing even mediocre pilots to keep a steady stream of DPS on their opponent. The agility is some of the best in the game, and its DPS is competitive vs fighters and medium ships. It has one shield, however, and very little armor/HP; the nanosecond that front shield goes down against OC'd neutron repeaters, the pilot's respawning at Port O.\n\nI was a Delta pilot for years, then an Arrow pilot for about 14 months. In March, I CCU'd to a Gladius, and the punishment that ship can take is exponentially more than an Arrow (it also lacks the killing power, however). Likewise, the 300 series has a lot more survivability from its hull and its shields, though will take more hits from lack of agility (which isn't saying much, the Arrow's damn hard to compete with maneuverability-wise).\n\nTL;DR: 325a if you're primarily doing PvE, it'll handle it fine (but again, a souped-up Freelancer would be better). Arrow if you specifically ***want*** to be a light fighter pilot (not a medium fighter pilot - being a light fighter is its own playstyle vs a medium or heavy fighter); the Arrow is unforgiving for pilots who want or need a little margin of error in their dogfighting skills.",
      "If you just need a dedicated fighter, I would choose the Arrow over the 325a. The Gladius is another good light fighter.",
      "The 325a has advantages, but they're not related to combat. You can log out in one, you can carry some stuff with you, and it'll likely have a longer range if it doesn't already.\n\nWhen it comes purely to combat though, fighter variants (325a, 125a, Aurora LN, Reliant Tana, etc) are by design always going to be inferior to dedicated fighters, else there'd be no reason to choose those.",
      "Despite the 325a’s description saying it’s a light fighter. It is not. I have a 325a but only for smuggling high value goods. If you want a dogfighter you have 3 solid choices. Sabre, Gladius and arrow.",
      "Considering you have more than one ship, then yeah go for it.\n\nIf it was your only ship I think it would have been a bad idea, the 325a is good all rounder and let’s you partake in more gameplay than a Arrow",
      "arrow over 325a any time",
      "I own all the fighters and I hardly ever bother to use the 325A, I'd rather fly the Avenger.",
      "If pure combat?? Yeah go Arrow or Gladius, and don’t forget!! You can unlock the Pirate Gladius and get that :) just beat pirate swarm and it’s going to show for you in the store. Red and black and comes default with all gimbals I believe.",
      "I did that upgrade at one point and regretted it. I felt my arrow would always lose its one engine. Once that happens it’s thrusters all the way home.",
      "I think the 325a is better due to more hp, shields and dps I thin even better missiles too.\n\nI owned a 325 and own a Arrow upgraded my 325a to an arrow regret it currently due to freelancer guns being bugged and the arrow having too little hp and dps.\n\nNot sure if people recommending the Arrow over 325a have flow it tbh. The 325a has a straight 2nd shield over the arrow making it way easier to do any combat in.",
      "I had an Arrow to start out and I upgraded to the Gladius. The arrow only has on sheild generator and the Gladius sacrifices a small amount of manuvering and gets 2 sheild generators. don't get me wrong the arrow is a cool ship but felt like it was made of paper. Claim jumper mission would get me one shot on occasion. Gladius is still fun to fly and is noticably more durable",
      "I traded out my 325a for a gladius.\n\nThen I got a Sabre as well.\n\nGladius, Arrow and Sabre are all better than the 325a, hands down. If all you care about is fighting.\n\nThat being said, you know what I missed? Being able to walk around in my damn ship, or bring people with me and for that you want a 325A.\n\nSo I recently rebought my 325a and couldn't be happier.\n\nImo, just get both.",
      "I love my arrow but there are times it lacks firepower. Against other fighters it is great but once you start throwing bigger ships in there it gets tedious. You can fix it some by doing a weapons load out swap but it is still kind of weak plus the one shield generator means death comes quickly when the enemy can hit you.",
      "Arrow over 325a but for only 1 super important reason: landing gear vs wheels. Am I the only person who dislikes the wheeled spaceships?!?",
      "Thank you, I found this answer especially helpful",
      "Out of curiosity, why? Does armor make that big of a difference? \n\nIt just seems strange considering the 325a has 1 S4 hardpoint and 2 S3, where the arrow can only do 2 S3 and 2 turreted S1. The missile load out is the same, and their SCM and afterburner speeds are very similar. According to dpscalculator the 325a may even have more shields.\n\nI assume the Arrow is a fair bit more maneuverable but I doubt it can dodge so much better that it makes a difference, and so long as you are maneuverable enough to consistently stay on target, why does it matter? Does the armor matter that much? The smaller profile?\n\nNot naysaying by any means, just trying to understand the difference.",
      "I agree if you got a starrunner and loaners.\n\nIf you had to pick only 1 I would say 325",
      "Don't forget the Defender my friend.  All the capabilities of a Sabre, but with an interior, 2 beds and 5x quantum fuel.",
      "Armor isn’t really in the game yet but I think the buff they HP to compensate.\n\nMy comments were based solely on the handling of the ships. The Arrow and Gladius are a tad more nimble and designed for space combat. The  300 series is built as a more well rounded ship with slight variations across variants.\n\nHonestly, I would recommend renting (or borrowing) the ships you are considering and form your own conclusions. What flies great for me might not work for you. I’m currently flying a Hawk and love how nimble a smaller ship can be.",
      "Oh dodging really does a lot especially now that weapons like mass drivers and omniskies aren't one shotting parts now unlike before, the arrow is a dedicated fighter unlike the 325a and its a heck of a lot smaller and low profile.\n\nArmor is non existant atm and yeah the small profile really helps the arrow eventhough it has only 1 shield she will usually outlast any fighter given the pilots skill. I've had eaten bigger ships like sabres and vanguards with my arrow with relative ease which I don't think I can do with my 325a cuz its a whole lot bigger and easier to hit."

The game requires you to explore, but in order to explore you must constantly manage your oxygen. Now to take another tact, if you have ever played the game \"Frostpunk\", you know you have the constant threat of ever decreasing temperatures hanging over your head. You are attempting to build resources and tools to help survive the impending threat. Another game that really expresses this is \"The Long Dark,\" although that one may get a little monotonous past a point as there isn't too much in the way of progression.\n\nBasically, I am looking for reccomendations for modpacks that provide this experoence to some degree. I am already familiar with, for example, Terrafirmacraft and I think that at least to an extent hardore versions like TFC+ provide this experience when you have to worry about the impending winter, and cold temperatures will force you to limit your exposure to the outdoors during that time.\n\nI think there also used to be a modpack back in the day where you started the game on the moon and had to worry about your oxygen supply, etc. \n\nBasically I really like the idea of an environmental struggle, and want to know what modpacks to this end you recommend?

Another game similar, though not quite right is [Subterfuge](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snappytouch.subterfuge) which is played online across days, or [Call of war](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bytro.callofwar1942) which is played across weeks, but both can be more time demanding than I would like because they are real time.\n\nIdeally I am looking for a game that is turn based, where, for example, everyone plays their turn (ideally simultaneously) over 1 or 2 days, and is played over a couple of weeks or more. Platform does not matter. Strategy is preferable but genre isn't super important. \n\nI know some online board games have features like this, in that case I am looking for any reccomendations of games of this sort that are fun to play?\n\nThank you :)",

    "selftext": "When you hold your mouse over the cost to research a technology, it tells youbthe factors that have modified the research cost, primarily the number of planets and systems owned.\n\n I was attempting a \"build tall\" playthrough, with minimal systems and planets, and was going for habitats as my mid game method of growth, but according to that research cost tab, each habitat counts as a planet. I don't know if this was always the case, but I don't really see the purpose of habitats if you are penalized in research the same amount as you are for a full blown planet, despite habitats inly having 12 tiles. While in the early game the production from a habitat might be better per pop then using a planet, this doesn't last once you get better upgradable buildimgs, since habitat buildings can't be upgraded, and the new research penalties no longer take into account population. \n\nMy point is, there is basically no reason to ever build a habitat in the current build. It costs you 10,000 minerals for a shitty, unupgradable planet that is only useful if you have troubles keeping your people happy, which is really only a problem in wide empires where you would never use a habitat. \n\nFrom a balance perspective, if the goal of habitats is to make building \"tall\" viable, perhaps habitats should still count as a research penalty, but for a different, lesser value then that of a planet, or perhaps only \"colonized systems\" being systems with at least one inhabited planet or habitat should count towards the research penalty, or considering the enormous cost of habitats at the moment they shouldn't have a research penalty at all. \n\nI searched the workshop for any mods that modify this, but couldn't find any at the moment. Thoughts or solutions?",

      "They do count as colonies. And they legitimately are colonies, so why not.\n\nI use them for research between 2250-ish (when you can first get them due to Star Fortress not showing up often earlier) and 2300-ish (when I’m colonizing my first ring world). At that point I’ll have 5-6 habs and that’s enough research to make a science nexus seem like a bad idea and build ring worlds first instead. Which means the penalty can’t be too bad. Of course, later in the game I might scrap them, but that’s okay.",
      "You got the math all wrong. \n\nLets consider a conservative early / mid game scenario:\n\n* intelligent pops (+10% to science output)\n* ~80% happiness (+10% to all output)\n* intellectual governor or academic privilege (+10% science output)\n* level 5 governor bonus (+10% total output, multiplying the total result instead of just adding to the other bonuses).\n* 11 research labs (2/2/2 as output)\n* 5% increased research penalty per planet\n\nRaw output is 2 * 11 * (1 + 0,1 + 0,1 + 0,1) * 1,1 = 31,46 of each science produced. Now, accounting for the research cost penalty, we can divide by 0,05 and thus we get the value 629,2. \n\nThat is how much _effective_ science **in each category** you must be generating for a science habitat to be a bad idea to build. Even if you used the console or a mod to spawn a ruined science nexus in your starting system, so you could have 2 full science nexuses in your starting system with no penalties at all, and did a life-seeded start you would still only reach ~500 science in each category. \n\nYes, running a pure science habitat will mean you needed to supply food, consumer goods and energy to power it, alternatively you could only run 6 labs, in which case you would only outperform a lone science nexus, at least until you managed to stack a few more bonuses, like putting a science ship doing research assist in place.",
      "> While in the early game the production from a habitat might be better per pop then using a planet,\n\nThat's your problem right there. You can't compare habitat production to planet production, because you're not making a choice between a habitat and a planet. You're making a choice between a habitat and a mining/research station.\n\nAlso:\n> While in the early game the production from a habitat might be better per pop then using a planet, this doesn't last once you get better upgradable buildimgs, since habitat buildings can't be upgraded\n\nThat's not true for energy or research. The only planet-side buildings that beat habitats there require Empire Capital-Complex or Betharian.",
      "Why would they not count as a colony?",
      "Thanks for mathing it out. That is better then I thought, but  my main problem is that there isn't a situation where it is ever better to build habitats rather then a planet. In general, having more planets now is always better then having few, even in the research category. It seems like the way to get the fastest research is to quickly grab as many planets as possible, and then either releasing/not bothering with the systems in between, or giving them to vassals. \n\nI reallise that is a bit cheesy, but I usually play with friends and have been trying to find ways to make a \"tall\" strategy be more viable. Good to know that habitats are probably better then not having them at all, despite the enourmous investment.",
      "Actually, planet-side buildings are equivalent or better even for Energy and Research.\n\nBefore 2.0 you'd have been correct about Research, but Laboratory Complexes got nerfed to 2/2/2 so, while more well-rounded, their yield is the same as planet-side research buildings (and as a small note, Labs take 3 energy versus 2.5 for level 3 planet research buildings).\n\nSolar Power Processors do yield more than Power Plant IVs, but only if you don't account for the +20% from an Energy Nexus. If, however, you can get a Spiral-Feed Power Hub then Habitats shoot ahead.\n\n\nAll of that said, Habitats are absolutely solid. For most of the game you're actually speeding up your tech progression by building them if you focus them on tech, and once you have a solid tech base you can convert them into Energy/Replicators to turbo-charge your economy.",
      "That is an interesting perspective, I just always thought of habitats as a way to make building tall have a comparative advantage to building wide, at least in research. You are correct about energy production still being decent on habitats, but research got nerfed to 2/2/2 and you can't build any of the buildings like an energy nexus on a habitat.\n\nWith the research penalty, I don't see any situation where building a habitat would be better then a planet, especially considering the initial resource cost, feeding into the broader problem that in 2.0, building tall isn't better then building tall in any way.\n\n I was hoping for a balance where being wide ensures more resources, bigger armies, etc. But comes at the cost of lower Unity, and research. Right now, the one planet strat is still maybe viable, but not if you are playing against other players. If habitats had a comparative advantage in the Unity and research departments though, which I don't think they do for mid to late game techs at the moment, then I think a tall strategy could actually compete with a wide strategy when playing with other players, rather then just being a fun novelty.",
      "Planets are and should be better than habitats. They are however also in limited supply and far more spread out. Ideally you can stick 3+ habitats in each of your original core systems while building ringworlds on the rest.",
      "How can you call that nerfed when the science cost increase from the fully colonised habitat is reduced from 22% extra science cost pre 2.0 to just 5% now? Habitats are buffed by alot in usefullness now."

    "selftext": "Disclaimer: Yes, I am a DD player. Yes my ships sink as often from the weight of my salt cargo as from the inevitable onslaught of attack planes. No, I do not expect any of what is said here to ever reach WG, I just want to talk to the Aether. \n\nI am genuinely confused as to why CVs are unbalanced and am looking for a productive dialogue so I can better understand the issue. \n\nSo, I feel like there is no reason for CVs not to be balanced. I get the practical issue of how WG has already invested in a relatively recent rework, and while I understand that the whole system cant be redone I feel like there are plenty of other tweaks and adjustments that would aid game balance tremendously, are historically accurate, and would cost very little. There are probably far more than the ones I have thought of too. \n\nOne is, why not make it so that when a squadron of planes spots a ship, rather then full on revealing them to the other time why doesn't it simply reveal the location of the ship without making it full on visible to the other team? Like when an enemy location has been revealed by your team but is still outside of your range to actually see them? This would not fix many of the balance issues with CVs, but it would make it so that when a fighter squad is attacking a DD there is an easier to balance form of counterplay where it is just the DD vs the CV instead of making the DD an easy target for the entire rest of the enemy team. AKA making any ship spotted by a plane visible on the mini-map only.\n\nA really simple change could be to put more of a limit on the total number of aircraft that can be deployed? Or simply reduce the refresh rate of getting new ones? Make it so that there is actually some degree of risk for CVs on attack runs and they have to weigh costs of attacking various ships. I know this gets better in higher tiers, but I still feel it is too low risk for CVs.\n\nAnother possibility could be creating a fuel mechanic for planes, limiting their reach across the map and how long they can spend searching for things. Make it so most bombers can only reach half or a third of the way across the map in a single go. This would be harsh, but could be counterbalanced in two ways. One is making planes cruising speeds faster, so you can still achieve the same frequency of attack, you simply need to actually position your CV in a location to support whatever attack you are making, instead of in the corner of the map, you would have to actually maintain some sort of position relative to your target. This would also make it so the early game CVs cant just rush planes across the map and take out a third of a DDs health without taking any risks or giving much opportunity for counter play. Another way this could be balanced is the addition of specific scout planes that have much more fuel/further ranges, and high flight speeds, but no weapons and low hp. This suggestion. Works particularly well with the aforementioned change in CV spotting mechanics. You could also simply make it so planes can only go so far from the attached CV, citing radio connection or fuel, or just a generic term like \"support radius\" idk.\n\nAnother good addition would be to add more ways a CV can use air to air fighters. Make it so they can deploy more, they can deploy them more quickly/easily, perhaps even attach them to follow around a ship. I find the latter solution particularly interesting, since it could make for an interesting dynamic where you could attach them to follow/defend an allied DD, but in so doing would be essentially revealing their rough location. \n\nIn conclusion, I would personally be very ok with adding one or many of these limitations, in exchange for making the armament of CV squadrons more deadly. One of the major issues with CVs at the moment is simply the lack of limitations, CVs can strike anywhere, be wherever, face very little risk, but not do all that much damage in the process. That is why if you talk to an experienced CV player, the main skill that is emphasized improving your rate of attack. Ya, there is a little bit of picking targets and some mechanical skill, but where other ship types have lots of room for team work, predictive strategies, and major challenges to getting better at the game, I think the CV skill curve is relatively flat.\n\nAdding more limitations to CVs would improve the game not only for non-CV players, but also for CV players. You can add strategic depth, make the game more challenging, and skill more rewarding.\n\nEdit: To be clear, I am talking about the ways CV's are unbalanced from a gameplay/player experience standpoint. I am aware that their win rate and estimated contribution to the match is balanced, at least on paper, at least in random battles. What I am talking about is how they break gameplay dynamics like the detection system or the risk/reward dynamics of the game generally. Yup, they are easily hard countered. They also make many ships in the game completely useless.",

      ">I am genuinely confused as to why CVs are unbalanced and am looking for a productive dialogue so I can better understand the issue.\n\nLet's start from the beginning: what is your operating definition of balance? WG's definition: two players of equal skill should have equal influence on the game outcome, regardless of the ship they play. By this definition, and looking at the [MapleSyrup](http://maplesyrup.sweet.coocan.jp/wows/ranking/index.html) data, it looks like CVs are about right, and DDs are the class that are currently out of balance. Of course, the MapleSyrup leaderboard isn't nearly as good a data source as WG's internals, but I very much doubt they agree that CVs are unbalanced today.\n\n>One is, why not make it so that when a squadron of planes spots a ship, rather then full on revealing them to the other time why doesn't it simply reveal the location of the ship without making it full on visible to the other team? Like when an enemy location has been revealed by your team but is still outside of your range to actually see them? \n\nThe main concern I have here is that strong DD players are clearly the most influential players in the game right now, and this would turn their influence up to 11. They just nerfed CV damage output on DDs considerably, to the point where I'm really not that concerned about most CV strikes as a DD. If you then follow that up with surface ships not being able to shoot the DD, I fear the only counter for a good DD player will be a better DD player.\n\n>A really simple change could be to put more of a limit on the total number of aircraft that can be deployed? Or simply reduce the refresh rate of getting new ones? Make it so that there is actually some degree of risk for CVs on attack runs and they have to weigh costs of attacking various ships. I know this gets better in higher tiers, but I still feel it is too low risk for CVs.\n\nAre you sure this actually makes CVs more balanced? If you look at the above definition, equal skill creating equal pull in games, I would say that plane count reductions increase the relative power level of unicum CVs.\n\n>Another possibility could be creating a fuel mechanic for planes, limiting their reach across the map and how long they can spend searching for things \n\nThis isn't compatible with the multiple strikes gameplay they want to enable. Plane turning circles are big, like much bigger than BB circles big, and the result is that the math doesn't go well. Say you want to make a 25km strike the maximum effective range. If the CV needs to be able to make 3 drops at 25km, that means they can also make 1 drop at about 40km. So, range limitations end up not mathing out. They could work if you go back to all the planes striking at once, but that's a big ol' can of worms.\n\n>Another good addition would be to add more ways a CV can use air to air fighters. Make it so they can deploy more, they can deploy them more quickly/easily, perhaps even attach them to follow around a ship. I find the latter solution particularly interesting, since it could make for an interesting dynamic where you could attach them to follow/defend an allied DD, but in so doing would be essentially revealing their rough location.\n\nHere too, you are creating a bigger gap in skill between CV players. Are you really sure you are making CVs more balanced? Is it your impression that the skill gap between CV players is currently too small? If so, why?\n\n>I think the CV skill curve is relatively flat. \n\nI think the CV skill curve is comparable to the BB and CA skill curves. We see elite players of all three classes winning at about the same rate.",
      "WG is either unable or willing to do tweaks like this. Reasons are unclear. The only thing they ever tried with RTS was to change T4-5 to auto drops only. Then they just decided to nuke the whole thing, whereas most normal developers would've tried a lot of tweaks to see what would work",
      "I was on hiatus at the time so I can't say, but to my understanding somewhere in the 8.3-8.4 range of patches, CVs got nerfed significantly and the CV player numbers plummeted. They were then buffed back up to about the performance we have today.\n\nAnd that I think is really why CVs aren't more \"balanced\" - because WG wants people to play (and buy) carriers. \n\nI don't like CVs, and I feel like they've taken a big old shit on the dynamics that made WoWs fun, especially with how they've impacted a pretty wide swath of ships that used to be good,and now aren't because the eye in the sky is always there. I do however play CVs from time to time because I want to understand both sides of this argument.\n\nI do think spotting needs to be changed. Removing the spotting ability from the fighters would be a good start and I truly believe (despite Wargaming saying it would be too confusing for player) that aircraft should provide mini-map spotting only. We understand how that works for radar and in hurricanes and I'm sure as players we would grasp it. It would still be an invaluable tool to know where the enemies are, but we could still rely on our DDs to provide the hard spotting for distant targets. There is no reason IMO for wargaming NOT to try this.",
      "> You can add strategic depth, make the game more challenging, and skill more rewarding. \n\nWell... to give you the very short format: According to WG this is not wanted as it a) doesn't fit the game and b) is too much for the average player to do (\"Steering your hull AND your planes at the same time? NO! Too difficult for the average casual!\").\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWG's goal was to make more attractive which ... somewhat worked? Afaik the current CV player numbers are slightly above RTS numbers but still on the lower end of the envelope WG had envisioned for CV's.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese numbers however are somewhat artificially held up by making T4 CV's so strong that new CV players think: \"Oh .. this is somewhat good. I can do something.\" and progress, only to be shunted down at T6. Or in other words: If you'd take away e.g. Hosho's OPness, CV player numbers would dwindle again, and WG's rework would be a loss. \n\nHence, they leave it as is, and call it a day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep also in mind regarding skill, that the current game play is more challenging to some players, as these players do WORSE in the current CV's as they did back in RTS CVs. No automated attacks to help bad players. So in all essence, the skill gap - that WG wanted to minimize - widened.",
      "Problem with minimap only spotting is that most randoms don't look at minimap and expect CV to spot them everything. Right now CV dmg is low relative to tier, so if you remove team play functions, they don't really have a role. \n\nHowever, CV spotting is also a source of frustration for the CV oftentimes since teammates love to shoot at your low hp targets and \"helpfully\" kill them while you're flying towards them, parasitizing on your spotting which you aren't rewarded for.\n\nI've thought about a way to fix these issues and at the same time fix fighter planes as well. The solution would be to make strike plane spotting minimap only, but give fighters full spotting ability. Also instead of only 1 fighter per squad, squads now get more fighters the higher tier the CV is. With a tier 10 CV getting 3 or even 4 fighter consumables on different slots, with lower number of uses each compared to current CV to keep the total fighter number somewhat similar.\n\nThis means that a competent CV can still spot targets by placing fighters strategically, but he can also lay complex fighter patterns to protect his team. 2 or more fighters in a row would make a certain friendly ship invulnerable. Alternatively, he can lay a wall of 4 fighters to lengthen enemy flight time. \n\nIt would also tone down spotting of DDs without hurting spotting on most other classes, since fighters are fragile and DD air spotting ranges means fighters will always be in AA range while spotting. If played correctly, this CV suggestion might even have more team play opportunity as multiple fighters can spot multiple areas at the same time.",
      "its because wg doesn't want to nerf their precious class, and also wg has no idea how to balance a game in the first place",
      "Simple way to balance CV:\nRework the spotting interactions.\nCV balanced",
      "Because it's not possible in the current format.",
      "Because spreadsheet says they are balanced.\n\nSeriously, I'm not joking, WG isn't going to just sit there and have a class be balanced.\n\nThe issue is, WG's balance philosophy revolves solely around objective numbers in their spreadsheet. So while CVs are objectively balanced in terms of win rate, etc. They're still unfun to play against.\n\nThat's the key here. Balanced != fun to play against.\n\nThey don't give a shit that CVs are unfun, they don't care that they're unhealthy for the game, as long as the numbers are fine they won't touch them.",
      "My idea there two components:\n\nShit design in a first place. You can modify it only in a limited number of ways, which makes it hard to keep CVs a little bit fun (because imo current CV gameplay is definition of boredom, but hey what do I know, if there lots of guys playing it) and being somewhat on par in terms of game influence with surface ships.\n\nAnd second, which much more probable, deliberate removal of concealment, to make numerous casual players happy. That's what real feedback looks like [https://i.redd.it/3if99i9ambg51.jpg](https://i.redd.it/3if99i9ambg51.jpg) and WG wants this guy's money. So, while hypothetical \"concealment rework\" gonna scare off to much of current playerbase, some sky-cancer could provide spotting almost in every game, which helps to make pesky horrid \"invisible ships\" much less noticeable... Or would it be more correct to say: more noticeable?",
      "You can’t, it’s literally impossible to balance a ship class that doesn’t physically fight another ship",
      "First off, CV's actually got a small balancing in the latest update. AP bomber damage output was reduced and all rocket plane aiming reticles were turned horizontally to make angling against them nose in a universal tactic to reduce damage. So it's not like CV's aren't getting balanced at all, but the main issues still remain.\n\nFirst off, all the bullshit features CV's have should be removed or replaced with sensible ones:\n\nAir repair party. Come on, how did they even think this is sensible? Were there a R2 units on WW planes or am I missing something? Yes, many ship consumables are a bit ridiculous as well, but this is just another insult on top of rare ships having any significant AA to shoot down planes. I would even give planes a bit more HP to remove the air repair. \n\nPlane immunity. During and after the attack, the planes that fly automatically up and can't be controlled should not be immune to damage, it's just ridiculous. I understand that this is omplemented because planes flying straight would die instantly to flak. So why not make them only immune to flak damage?\n\nInfinite planes. Obviously, this is stupid like OP said, even though they are not completely infinite. Best counterargument is that ships have infinite ammo too, but in reality almost all ships could carry more ammo that they are even theoretically able to shoot during the 20 minute match. Rare cases include ships like Colbert, which could spend its historical 4800 shell max capacity in around 15 minutes of continuous shooting in-game. In turn, CV's can spend over 2 times their real life hangar size in a game. Increased plane recovery speed in exchange for limited hangar would be nice.\n\nThe stupid rules for DOT damage and CV DCP. Simply, make it like it was pre-rework, because having superior everything compared to other ship classes is just unfair. Pre-rework CV's were good on one aspect: they followed the same rules that other classes did.\n\nThen, this is not a stupid feature anymore, but way too oppressive: the plane spotting should be limited, as OP said. I think a good start would be giving it a render delay like they gave to radar, since for a DD getting spotted by a plane and a radar are essentially very similar situations. The spotted ship would appear on a minimap but get rendered only after being spotted for 6 seconds. This would actually give CV's more need to choose between attacking and spotting a target, increasing the amount of strategic play.",
      "The RTS game didn't work either.\n\nYou can't have two people playing a different game inside of the same game and expect it to work.",
      ">I was on hiatus at the time so I can't say, but to my understanding somewhere in the 8.3-8.4 range of patches, CVs got nerfed significantly and the CV player numbers plummeted. They were then buffed back up to about the performance we have today.\n\nThis is pretty much right. 083 and 084 both were CV nerf patches, but CVs were still much stronger than today. 085 through 087 was a series of AA rework patches, the first of which made CVs borderline unplayable and the CV population went to near zero. By 087, the full AA rework, including the sector mechanics we use today, was in place and CVs became playable for non-unicums again. Overall power level of CVs only down somewhat today compared to the 087 level.\n\n>I do think spotting needs to be changed.

It would still be an invaluable tool to know where the enemies are, but we could still rely on our DDs to provide the hard spotting for distant targets. There is no reason IMO for wargaming NOT to try this.\n\nSpotting is really the core of people's feelings about CVs. Whether you want the game to be more about concealment or more about gunnery is probably the most important source of your opinion on CVs.\n\nThat being said, I can think of at least one reason: this gives too much influence to DDs. DDs are already, even with the relatively high level of CV spotting and CV-DD harassment, the most influential class. If you make it so that shooting things requires DD eyes, you may make elite DD players like the elite RTS CV players in terms of game influence.",
      "That's the thing. They're not trying - it won't hurt to stick it on test server and see how it goes",
      "Ya, that is why I listed that suggestion first since I thought it was the simplest and made the most sense. Like I said, I would happily trade off CVs doing more damage for some limitations like this because the spotting mechanics just throw all the DD dynamics into chaos.",

So in all essence, the skill gap - that WG wanted to minimize - widened.\n\nThis is false.   In the RTS days, a bad player who would send automated attacks could easily have their planes wiped by any opponent CV who knew how to use strafe fighters.   \n\nThe skill gap was caused by CV vs CV interactions, which have been (practically) eliminated in the current iteration of carriers. \n\nYou can't tell me that lining up a single reticle today, is more challenging than micromanaging 4 squadrons in a RTS setting.   While there is a learning curve to avoiding higher tier AA fire, it's still not comparable to challenges of the RTS mode.   \n\nAnd to boot, CVs today will continue to regenerate planes even after losing all of the ones in their hangars.",

But maybe WG decided against it because control 2 different entities simultaneously in the game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Then, this is not a stupid feature anymore, but way too oppressive: the plane spotting should be limited,\n\nThey already gave DDs double concealment against planes.\n\nMight be still a valid point for high ranking CBs but spotting is not that of a game breaker in your average random battle. Stealth cruiser also exist for that point of complaint.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR outside spotting all your arguments are either subjective bias or already fixed and your knowledge about CVS is outdated (like so many other players here).\n\nEdit: spelling",

      "Puffin, what's your personal take on how WG could improve game balance?   You've clearly stated that DD's are currently the pivotal class, and I agree with that.  \n\nI feel like CV sentiment is going to slowly shift from lots of triggered DDs, to butthurt BBs with the 0.9.7 changes.  People just don't realize yet how little CVs can do to destroyers now.    As CV players adapt to the new mechanics, they're going to logically start hunting bigger ships similar to the German line.   \n\nYou seem to have a great understanding of the current power level of each class (at high PR gameplay), so what would you do if you had control of the WG balance department?   Would you choose to prioritize concealment, or gunnery, or something else?",
      "Look at the average DMG of e.g. the Midway prior to the rework and now.\n\nAccording to wows-numbers, the worst avg. DMG RTS Midway was about 27.6k over 140 battles.

With a maximum DMG of (sit down): 29827, less than 30k maximum DMG!\n\nThis player's maxium DMG is barely above the avg. DMG of the worst RTS Midway player ...\n\nSo yes, basically I'm telling you (with data to back it up) that the average bad player in Warships is not able to line up a single reticle.\n\nEdit: I just saw, coincidentally, it's the same player... so yeah ... even \"worse\".\n\nKeep in mind, while the potato got strafed out of the sky by the unicum (that much is true in your argument), that worked only if the enemy was capable of strafing. If two potatoes however played against each other, what - given the amount of potato RTS players - was quite possible, both CVs could strike freely while they left clicked their fighters onto each other.\n\nToday?

      "I said that there are other magical consumables as well, but your example of repair party is a bad one. Ship is essentially a floating village with all kinds of features, it makes perfect sense that some damage can be repaired, except for the British superheal, it is ridiculous.

With planes, however, it makes no sense whatsoever.\n\nSlingshot got patched out by increasing the interval between attacks, not by removing the immunity. Of course WG couldn't do that because it would be sensible. So learn your CV's yourself before trying to show off your knowledge.\n\nI know that planes are not completely infinite, but the regen mechanic is still quite over the top, not just for Kaga and Enterprise. And if a CV has a limited hangar capacity, why shouldn't fighters be counted towards it? Also, I know that many of the mechanics are not historically accurate or realistic, but the fact is that CV's were OP also when they did have a limited hangar. I was talking about bullshit mechanics, and this is the most bullshit mechanic in the game. Other ship classes have them as well (torp aiming helper has always been an odd one to me), but they are more or less balanced.\n\nTL;DR You seem to be just another delusional CV main trying to make excuses for the bullshit other ships have to deal with. I'm not even sure why I keep answering to you guys, but maybe it's just because I'm an engineer, all engineers love arguing.",
      ">so what would you do if you had control of the WG balance department?\n\nThe thing is, most of what people are complaining about isn't balance. They want engagements to have the right feel. If you are asking how to balance the game most effectively, the answer is probably to buff rockets (since rockets are strong against unicum DDs and unicum DDs are the biggest balance issue), but literally nobody wants that.\n\nHere are some ideas on how to improve gameplay feel:\n\nDDs become more effective in open combat, less effective from stealth, and more durable under fire. Think of DDs moving towards the French model of gameplay. I would still have stealth torpedo DDs, but I would be aiming at a game balance where most DDs feel a strong pull towards shooting when they can. In my view, DDs should be fast flankers and ambushers that pop up at the worst possible time for the opponent, doing similar average damage per round as cruisers.\n\nCV rockets become more accurate, and scatter as a cluster rather than spraying wildly, but the travel time of the rockets is increased to something like 4 seconds. This way, maneuverable ships can fool the CV and the rockets can miss, in the same way you can make a Zao miss.\n\nI would like to see buffs to small caliber AP, from 100mm up through 203mm. AP shells are naturally more skilltesting than HE shells, and ships that use only one type of ammunition reduce gameplay depth. In general, I want to see ships shooting broadsides of the same kind of ship with AP -- Gearing to use AP against DDs, Wooster to use AP against CLs, Venezia to use AP against CAs. Small caliber HE should be for bigger ships or angled ships.\n\nWe need to do something about the high tier healing meta. HE damage at the top end of the game is really over the top, as is firestarting capability, because everyone and their dog is packing 4 heals and fire prevention. You can see this in discussions of high tier CVs -- people only want to talk about MvR and Hakuryu, especially the AP bombers, because those break heals. This is also a problem for high tier DD design, because healing and fire protection tuned for Smolensk is going to utterly ruin Gearing's gun efficiency. If you ask me, the fix here is to nerf healing a lot, then nerf cruiser HE spam some. Then we can get to a meta where AP and HE feel roughly balanced.\n\n>Would you choose to prioritize concealment, or gunnery, or something else?\n\nGunnery, but this is opinion and not about balance. I think the game is at its best when most things are visible most of the time and the team that is better at getting to and fighting from good positions wins.\n\nI also want to prioritize mobile gameplay. Ships that aren't moving should get pounded if the enemy can see them. Real ships don't fight at anchor. From a gameplay perspective, a ship that isn't moving has very little ability to express skill, so we should push everyone to want to be moving.",
      "I see your data, and wanted some context as to WHY and HOW these numbers could exist.   Potatoes will be potatoes, but those numbers simply don't make sense when thought about.  Here is a brief summary of what I found:   \n\nIn looking at the bottom 10 Midway players in terms of Average Damage, I saw several common trends.\n\n*  All 10 players had extensively played RTS CV prior to the rework.\n\n*  Post-rework, only 2 players have played the Langley or Ranger for more than 50 games COMBINED.   \n\n* 6 of these had NEVER played either the Langley or Ranger post-rework.\n\nThese are not perfect statistics, as I did not factor in Co-op battles, and cherry picking numbers from the worst possible players isn't conducive to good data.\n\n**But what this tells me is that the RTS players you are referencing, haven't actually gone through the learning process to understand the rework CVs.**  \n\nThere is a distinctive learning curve with all higher tier ships, CVs included.   WarGaming designed the CV progression to teach aspects of the game at each tier - T4 is aiming, T6 is an introduction to AA, T8 is target selection, and T10 uses everything you've learned.    By skipping the lower tiers (since they previously owned the high tier RTS CVs), these potatoes are unfathomably bad when playing the Midway.   \n\n> Today? Rework Midway wanders into the flak bubble of a Shimakaze and gets nuked out of the sky\n\nCan we consider this question by throwing out those outside standard deviation?   I looked at the average Midway damage at exactly the 10th percentile:  the rework CV averages 47,165 damage per game, where as the RTS CV averaged 63,570.\n\nThis is generally expected, as WG reduced CV damage by roughly 22% across the board post-rework.    In the 10th percentile, rework CV is 25% lower than the RTS (which is pretty alright, all things considering).\n\nWhile 47,165 is still a bad damage total for the Midway, saying that a Shimakaze will nuke Midway planes out of the sky is a farce.   In reality it would mean the player attempts to hit a Shimakaze, but runs into the flak range of a cruiser.",
      ">With planes, however, it makes no sense whatsoever.\n\nI agree that it's not remotely realistic design, but the plane heal consumable serves a useful gameplay purpose. Fundamentally, good gameplay should trump realism.\n\n>Slingshot got patched out by increasing the interval between attacks, not by removing the immunity. Of course WG couldn't do that because it would be sensible. So learn your CV's yourself before trying to show off your knowledge.\n\nImmunity to AA in the recovery period is a necessary evil in the current AA system. An AA rework would be needed to make it work.\n\nI tend to think an AA rework is a good idea, because the current AA is too simple and leaves little to surface ship skill, but WG seems very hesitant to increase the depth or complexity of AA design.\n\n>I know that planes are not completely infinite, but the regen mechanic is still quite over the top, not just for Kaga and Enterprise.\n\nThis is a tuning thing, not a mechanical issue. The regen mechanic is quite a good idea. It prevents bad players from being hard deplaned. It prevents good players from spamming their best squadron early in the game.\n\nIf you want less planes regenerated, that's a knob we can turn. The question is how else you would change the CV in order to keep the design in balance, because the current level of plane regen appears to be pretty healthy in terms of damage done and win rate by player skill.\n\n>And if a CV has a limited hangar capacity, why shouldn't fighters be counted towards it?\n\nBecause fighters are awful. You'd rather have 1 more strike plane than 10 fighters. No sane commander would load any of the fighter planes as they exist onto their CV."
